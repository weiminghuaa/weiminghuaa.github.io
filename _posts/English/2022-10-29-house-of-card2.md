# HOUSE OF CARDS
Adonai
26 de diciembre de 2018

## season 1 

### Chapter 5

what do you think of Darren Jarvis?

at CBS? 

He wants me to be a correspondent.

not worth your time. 

what about Greer Fisher at MSNBC?

stick to writing. (继续撰稿) Do Tv on the side.(电视只作为副业)

you're more than a talking head.

how about Slugline?

what's Slugline?

If I said Politico want to hire me, what would you say?

I would say that that picks my interest.

six month from now. Slugline will be what Politico was a year and a half ago. everyone at Politico reads it. because Slugline's breaking stories before they are. 

I wonder why I've never heard of it.

everyone's a free agent. they write whatever they want, wherever they are. most people write from their phones.

well, if freedom and exposure are what they're offering, I would say that is a meeting worth taking.

this Hammerschmidt thing is blowing up. I think he might get fired. there's gotta be 1,000 tweets here. people defending me, people trashing(<非正式>损坏，毁坏；<非正式>抨击，谴责) me. there's even a hashtag "Go Zoe."

we mustn't leave any trials(烦人的事，惹麻烦的人；).

all of my contacts are in there.

then it's time for you to get some new contacts. don't worry, I'll get you a phone. I'll get you two, in fact. one for work and a burner for play. expect them this afternoon. oh and go Zoe.

the reporter?

yes.

just this once.

I'm not sure.

what does she offer us?

a mouthpiece(喉舌；代言人；送话口) when we need one. she's been very useful so far.

what does she want?

access, a seat at the table.

sounds like she's getting the better side of the bargain(交易；契约；特价商品 | vi. 讨价还价).

she can be controlled.

are you sure?

she can, I promise you.

okay, If you say so. the moment you want me to end it..

I know, Francis.

I should get ready for work.

hey.

Didn't think you'd be in till later.(我以为你过一会才来)

This is your agenda(待议事项，议事日程) for the day. Here's your schedule for the rest of the week. these are papers that need to be approved or signed. over here are your one-sheets for committee meetings and briefs on upcoming legislative(立法的；（与）立法机关（有关）的) action. I filled Ashley in. she can cover until you find a replacement.

Christina?

what?

Thank you. for getting all this in order. Ashley can call me if you have any questions about what's on your desk.

is he here yet. 

I put him in your office.

Marty Spinella, head lobbyist for the teachers' union. He wants to rip(撕裂，（使）划破；迅速扯开) my head off and peel it like an orange. why? because I lied to him, but what choice did I have when the truth would've ended the conversation before it began?

I'll call you back.

Marty.

you funking lied, Frank.

no, no, you lied to my fucking face.

Marty, I did not lie.

Did not? we spent the whole weekend in that room, pouring(倾倒，倒出) over this bill line by line, and nowhere did it say anything about collective bargaining.

let's calm(镇静，平和；宁静，安静) down and sit down, and we will discuss this.

I'll explain everything that's going on. and we'll talk it out no matter how long it takes.

no, no more, this is gonna be a very short meeting. cause only one of two things are gonna happen: either you assure(使确信，向……保证；) me right now that amendment(修正，修订之处；美国宪法修正案) is out, or I'm walking out that door. and I'm gonna start launching missiles(导弹，飞弹；投掷物).

the amendment wat never intended to stay in the bill. it was just there for leverage(影响力，手段；杠杆力，杠杆作用；<美>杠杆比率), that'a all.

you threatened(威胁，恐吓；威胁到) to cut federal funding from union school districts?

that's not a poker chip(筹码), Frank. that's a goddamn(该死的；讨厌的；受诅咒的) dirty bomb.

look, the amendment is not staying in the bill. I just need you to work with me on performance standards.

performance standards?

are you fucking kidding me?

you agreed that they were already out. you can't just put them back in.

Marty, look.

I have a reputation on uphold(支持，维护（法规、制度或原则）；认可，维持). I am the one that made the union reps(代表) stay here for you while you were in Gaffney playing with your fucking Peachoid. you tell me right now, is that amendment in or out?

there is a middle ground here, Marty. we just have to find it. I take that as a no. okay.

Marty, do not start a war you know you're gonna lose.

you fuck me, I fuck back.

September, Marty and I have a good working relationshi. or used to. you can see he has a temper. but I can usually cut though that and reason with(对（某人）以理相劝，劝告（reason with）) him.

But I may have pushed him too far, which is worrisome(令人担心的，使人发愁的，让人焦虑的). Friends make the worst enemies. 

How'd it go?

what did you hear?

a lot of 'fucks'.

well, that pretty much says it. let's think this through.

we've got the DNC leadership meeting.

what?

I'd say you could skip it. but Birch just dumped(扔掉；（为逃跑而）急忙放下；推卸) it on us.

when?

it's here in 12 minutes.

why here and not the DNC headquarters(总部，总公司；司令部，指挥部)?

the DNC is doing renovations(翻新，整修). they're gonna be green energy efficient(生效的，效率高的).

oh, that's a charming(吸引，迷住；诱使，哄诱) use of party funds.

we've only been in this space about three months.

it's cool.

not exactly the herlad, is it?

have you been to those offices?

yes, wrist(令状)-slitting(划开，割开) was in order.

so, who else is courting(奉承，讨好；设法取得) you?

a few people

you mean everyone.

there were a lot of e-mails this morning.

this's not surprising. you're having a moment.(风头正旺) people are interested, I'm one of them. but if eight minutes passes on anything. I get bored. in eight minutes, I can be bored with you. unless you keep me interested. I think you can. and I think this is the place for you to keep the rest of the world interested too. It's your call. I won't chase(追逐，追赶；匆忙赶往，急奔) you.

I'm definitely tempted(引诱，诱惑；怂恿).

take as long as you want to look around. e-mail me your figure, I'll call you back with a counter.

This is our top priority. Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania. we need all of them, or walker is one-term precedent. Pennsylvania is why he picked Matthews as a running mate(朋友，伙伴；同伴). but now we have to find a replacement. the special election is this November.

Patricia Whittaker, DNC Chair. a rare example of someone whose head is in the game instead of up their backside. competence(能力，胜任；权限) is such an exotic(奇异的，异国风情的) bird in these woods(树林，森林；木头) that I appreciate it whenever I see it. this also affects the house, the new governor will oversee(监管，监督；看到，无意中看到) redistricting. we lose seats here, that means we could lose our majority in Washington.

well, The RNC is backing Jack Swofford, ex-Mayor(镇长，市长) of Pittsburgh. he's got statewide name recognition(承认，接受；表彰，赞誉). and compaign machinery(机器，机械（尤指大型机械）；体系，机制) in place. it's been three months, and we don't have dick(一知半解地摆弄，瞎弄；<俚>（男子）与（某人）性交).

what about the AG? Ben Pluckett?

No, ben's got his eyes set on the senate in 14.

which he'll lose because he botched(笨拙地弄糟) a sex offender(犯罪者，违法者；造成问题的人) sting(警察为抓住罪犯而设计的）圈套，骗局) last year.

There's always McHolland. He's 78.

when's the last time he held office, when Carter was precedent?

Reagan, but same difference.

He has dignity(尊严，自尊；庄严，端庄，庄重；), he has gravitas(庄严；庄重；庄严的举止). If you need someone to fill Matthews' shoes.

you can't fill him Matthews' shoes, so we shouldn't even try.

we need a fresh face.

the state has a weak bench(长凳，长椅；长方形工作台).

let's go through all the sitting Congressmen one by one. and see if anybody sticks out from the crowd.

all right. I got the list right here.

okay, go ahead.

Pennsylvania's first district, Peter Russo. cross him off, he's no good. no experience, no chops.(能力一般)

okay, moving on, second district, Gwendolyn Pierce.

no, Gwen's too controversial(有争议的，引发争论的). very vocal(嗓音的，发声的，歌唱的；直言不讳的，大声表达的) on abortion(流产，堕胎；失败；).

and Caroline?

she's good.

And the boys?

all fucking four of them. you feed them.

you got any pictures on your phone?

come on, let's cut the shit, Peter, will ya? what are we gonna do about the shipyard?

BRAC had their hearing. they slated(批评，抨击；预定，计划，安排) it for closing.

yeah, and why didn't you testify? we're talking 12,000 jobs here.

my hands were tied, Paul. people wanted it closed. I was under a lot of pressure. 

From who?

people high up the food chain. there was nothing I could do.

that's bullshit(胡说).

you go back to BRAC. you talk to the DOD. you talk to the Secretary of Navy. you do something.

It's not gonna happen.

ok, why not?

I told you, it's political.

okay, so I'm supposed(预期，推断；假定) to go back to the shipbuilders' association and say what now exactly? that they're out of work because Peter Russo's playing politics?

I mean, Jesus, Peter. we're the ones who got you fucking elected in the first place. now you're gonna turn your back on us?(你现在背叛我们？)

you should go.

seriously(严重地，恶劣地；严肃地，认真地)?

I just got here. you're kicking me out now? hey, I'm fucking talking to you. I thought we grew up together. but this guy sitting behind his big desk, I don't even know who the fuck he is. where's the Peter Russo who knew how to throw a punch(一拳，一击) when his back was against the wall. that guy was my friend.

every teacher in the country a month before school ends?

Doesn't need all of them. 15, 20 states, that's all.

The AFT and NEA can't agree on anything. 

you underestimate Marty Spinella.

so which one do we target?

we have a better chance with the NEA.

you think Chuck Sloan will bite(上钩)?

Cooperate, we'll give your people protection, and a place at the banquet(宴请；参加宴会).

Fight us, we break you. He'll bite, Get him on the phone.

It's after 2:00.

Spinella is potentially(可能地，潜在地) mobilizing(动员，组织；调动，调用) the largest teachers' strike(罢工，罢市，罢课) in United States history.

Nobody's sleeping.

I'll call him right now.

I'm sorry, are we being too loud?

a little.

what are you working on?

the gala. there's so much to do.

did Nancy send you my list?

she did.

what'd you think?

it's a good list. thanks for inviting them. 

is something wrong?

it's still not anywhere near what Remy brought to the table. San Crop offered 1.5 million, Francis. I'm adding up the numbers, and we're only at half a million.

I got Chuck on the phone.

In a minute.

I can make more calls.

Enough to raise a million-five?

I can at least get us closer.

I'm going to bed. Don't move any of this around.

Claire, we made the decision to turn Remy down.(拒绝雷米) no one forced you. I thought we were okay on this.

you're right. good night, Francis.

this is Adam. leave a message.

hi, adam. it's me. I know it's late, but, well, I was really just calling to thank you again for the photographs. I'm sure they're gonna be a big hit at the auction(拍卖；（桥牌）叫牌阶段). I hope you're well.

right this way, Mr. Hammerschmidt.

he's here.

Good afternoon, Tom.

Legal?

did you say it, or didn't you?

to you and to anyone who asks, yes, I did. Do we really need them? 

not unless I should expect a fight.

you shouldn't.

give us a few moments.

it's not what you called her, it's that you let her leave the building.

I know how to run a paper, Margaret. who I don't know how to do is run a paper staffed(雇用工作人员) with people I can't control.

was she really out of control?

to my understanding, she simply turned down a new position.

it's her attitude. it's the way she turned it down.

did you think to ask her what she'd rather do instead?

is it my job to pander(迎合；勾引；怂恿；拉皮条) to all my employees.

my employees. and if they have something to offer that you don't, yes, it's your job. we've been through this, Tom. the paper's operating at a loss. we need people like Zoe.

I'm very aware(知道的，明白的；察觉到的) of how much we're hurting, Margaret. staff reductions, dip(浸，蘸；下降，下沉) in circulation(发行量，销售量；血液循环). each one of those faces, and every subscriber we lose, they keep me awake at night(失眠). now, I won't argue the business side of things. it's neither my place nor my area of expertise(专长，专门技能（知识）；专家的意见). but know this, Zoe Barnes, twitter, blogs, enriched media, they're all surface(表面；水面，地面；桌面).(肤浅) they're fads(尤指短暂和无根据的）时尚，狂热；一时的爱好). they aren't the foundation this paper was built on, and they aren't what will keep it alive. we have a core readership that thirsts for hard news. those are the people I work 80 hours a week for. and I won't be distracted(注意力分散的，心烦意乱的) by what's fashionable.

that's your resignation letter. hand it to the lawyers on the way out. I'll give you some privacy(隐私，秘密；清静).

no, no, stay. it'll be quick. we'll get a drink.

we're goint to launch right here in Washington. we'll see how congress likes it when the streets are teaming with unsupervised(无人监督的；无人管理的) school kids. then we'll phase out the rest of the country. everybody hold on for one minute. 

what's up?

The NEA is out.

hang on, what?

they pulled out.

why?

he wouldn't say.

hold on for one more minute.

Chuck Sloan, get him on the phone right now.

I've got him right here.

is he muted?

yes.

hey, Chuck. it's Marty. 

listen, you can't do this. if we don't stay united now, we don't have a... you hired me to represent your interests, right? how can I possibly lobby for the teachers when congress sees us splintering(分裂，裂成碎片) before we even put up a unite... all right. did Underwood get to you? whoa, Frank is dishonest and manipulative(操纵的，善于摆布（他人）的). you've seen that he's lied to us already. wait whoa whoa whoa, Chuck, Chuck! son of a bitch!

where are you?

I'm at the office.

false?

you don't believe me?

not for a second.

where are you?

about to walk into a meeting.

with who?

someone I have to punish(处罚，惩罚)?

give me a name.

no name.

what did this person do wrong?

lie to me.

how will you punish him?

what makes you think it's a him?

hold on, I have to take this. where are you?

me. I am not at the office. you're going to give me a new one of these every week?

well, I can't continue to... not without protection.

nobody tells me when to work and when to play.

I'm not being unreasonable, Zoe.

If you can't trust me, we shouldn't be doing this at all.

well, then, how do we establish our trust?

I have been very discreet(谨慎的，周到的).

oh, professional discretion(自行决定权，判断力; 谨慎，慎重). yes, but this is new territory(领土，版图，领地).

you have a camera on your phone. pictures. the kind I wouldn't want my father to see.

well, I'm going to need more than that. lie back.

I want everything packed for tomorrow.

we checked already, dad

oh, did you? those are my pink nikes on the kitchen counter(柜台；对立面；计数器)? and you, autobot, what is Optimus Prime(擎天柱) doing under my bed? He better transform(使改观，使变形，使转化) himself into your backpack before you have to leave tomorrow.

hey, dad? Is Christina coming back?

um, I don't think so, buddy(<非正式>朋友；<美，非正式>老兄，兄弟). No.

oh, I liked her.

Me, too. she's cool.

yes, she's cool. and you guys gotta brush your teeth. and then check the rooms again. and then it's time for beed. get it, pumpkins(南瓜)?

dad, you know I hate it when you call us pumpkins.

go before I turn you into a pie.

Peter Russo.

he's a drunk(酒鬼).

he's at the moment, a very functional one. Imageine if he was sober(未喝醉的，清醒的；严肃的，冷静的). (如果他戒酒了会怎么样)

even so, you run him for governor. people are going to dig into his past.

well, we turn that into an asset(有利条件，有价值的人或物；资产，财产), not a liability(负债，债务). here's who I was, here's who I am now.

you saw how they dismissed him, in three seconds at the leadership meeting.

Patty Whittaker is very open-minded, and I am very persuasive(有说服力的，能使人信服的).

you think Russo even wants it?

any kid who's made it from the streets of South Philly to the Capitol Rotunda(圆形大厅；圆形建筑) is ambitious. we just need to tap into that, surround him with the best people and then build the machine and push the go button.

so you think he could win.

I think he can be a contender(竞争者；争夺者).

okay, let's say we pull off a miracle and he wins. what do we gain(获得，赢得；受益；增加) by it?

isn't it better to be holding the reins(用缰绳勒（马）使停步或放慢步子，勒（马）；控制住，约束) in this race than watching from the stands?

you wife is on the phone.

put her through in here.

I understand the Pennsylvania's important fot redistricting

no, no, no, this isn't just about this race, Doug. expand your thinking. who else is from Pennsylvania? no, no, no, not in congress. the executive branch.

the vice president.

hello, my dear, Nancy had my tux(男士无尾半正式晚礼服) dry-cleaned so I won't embarrass(尴尬，窘迫；使难堪，使为难) 

The Cotesworth cancelled on us.

I'm leaving right now. I'll come get you. I've got to go.

what's going on?

the hotel, for tonight's gala. they refused let Claire into the ballroom. because their employees are union.

Spinella.

yeah, he can go after me all he wants. but to go after my wife? no class.(真下作) meet me at the Cotesworth.

you got it.(好的)

why can't we just move it to another place?

I looked into that, everything's booked. you have to reserve(预订；保留，预留) these things weeks in advance(预先，提前).

I've got Stamper online looking for another venue(（事件的）发生地点，（活动的）场所；<英，法律>审判地（指郡或区）) somewhere.

Francis, the delivery trucks are already at the Cotesworth. I can't have people showing up at a different place in case they don't get the email.

Claire, this is my fault, I feel awful.

there's a half a million on the line here.

I realize that.

And I can't keep having my work take these hits on behalf of yours. it's more than just an inconvenience(不便，麻烦；带来不便者，麻烦的人).

I know, we'll solve it.

hey, I just got your email.

what did you think?

you don't have to send me things before you post.

oh, I thought you might want to take a look.

the goal here is for everyone to post things faster than I have a chance to read them. If you're satisfied with the article, just put it up.

okay.

are you satisfied?

I think so.

okay, you are or you aren't. whatever hoops(绑，箍; 逼) the herald made you jump through...

I know.

let them go. it's okay to be opinionated(基于观点的；固执己见的), Zoe. and it's okay to go outside to get your hands dirty. you're no longer tied to a desk. or that pillow(枕头；蕾丝枕头; <美>坐垫，靠垫), for that matter.

I'm not going to post it. Midterm predictions(预测，预言). they're not news. they're bullshit.

well, I agree.

I can do better.

I think you can. feel free to blow my mind.(欢迎给我惊喜)

If we do this event, the whole staff walks out. I've got 300 guests. 

you signed a contract with my wife. 

we'll refund your wife's organization. and pay for whatever the costs of moving the event to a more appropriate(合适的，相称的) venue.

and we would have to refund a half a millon dollars in donations. can you pay fot that too? because I'm pretty sure there's casue for damages here.

I truly apologize, sir.

who's your boss?

I spoke with the owners, and they authorized me to do what I think is best.

and do they realize that they are shutting the door on 41 members of the United States of Congress?

yes, sir. they do. I had to make a very hard judgment call.

well, I seriously question your judgment. you know, word travels fast in this town. all those luncheons(正式的午餐，午宴) and conversation and dinners, it's going to be a shame(羞耻，羞愧；羞耻心) to lose all that work, isn't it?

Congressman, you are absolutely right, but if my staff walks out, I... please understand the predicament(窘况，困境；状态) I'm in.

I got an idea. I know what we're going to do. honey, they're no going to let us have it inside. we're going to have it right here, on their front steps, picnic style.
 
what do you need from me?

I need your manpower(人力；人力资源；劳动力).

yes, sir, I'm on it.(马上照办) okay, everybody, stop what you're doing, and listen up.

yeah, Frank, how soon?(多久?)

about three hours.

how many people we talking?

just 300.

the florist(花商，种花人；花店) is going to send over whatever he has.

great.

Francis, where are we with food?

I've got hotdogs, pizzas, and soul food coming, maybe something else.

Girls, here is what I want. I want four bars, two  on each level. the food can go there, the silent auction(拍卖；（桥牌）叫牌阶段) goes here. oh, and cancel the string(弦乐器，弦乐组) quartet(四重奏；四重唱；四件一套), let get a DJ.

Doug, how are we on booze(酒；酒宴)?

Kegs(小桶) are on the way now.

great. oh, and call Denise at the office, and have her bring every donation envelop she can find.

ohay, messages, people.

hello, Congressman Russo's office.

yes, can you hold on minute? thank you.

congressman, people keep calling about the shipyard, we don't know what to tell them. we just say we'll give you the message.

keep saying that.

here they are. the messages and all emails we've gotten, too. you want me to... have a good night.

who did we reach?

heald, the times, USA Today.

all right, I want affiliate(使隶属，使紧密联系) stations and cable(电缆；钢缆) news.(我还要电台和有线新闻) I want satellite(卫星；人造卫星) trucks(卡车，载重汽车) out here. I want this on line TV.

okay, I'm on it.(这就去办)

you can't do this here.

Zoe, 8 P.M. tonight. Hotel Cotesworh. Benefit(慈善活动) for my wife's charity(慈善组织，慈善机构). no, wash your face and let your hair down. this is work and play. see you.

I can tell you right now I'm going to need two dozen. Paul, I'm goint to need those by tomorrow, okay?

your guests are your problem, not mine, Julian.

I'll close the gate.

you know, I'm not expert in fire code, but I could imagine that locking your guests in is a bigger violation(违背，违反；侵权行为) than having them walk around us.

this is trespassing(擅自进入，侵入（他人土地或建筑物）) on private property. you're breaking the law.

right, okay?

let me get Barney Hull on the phone here for you. here you go. it's ring.

who is Barney Hull?

the police commissioner(首长，长官；（委员会的）委员). no? okay.

you'd rather talk to in person, that's great. he's coming to the party. I'll be sure to introduce him to you. thanks for your hosptiality(殷勤款待，好客).

bar comes over here. put all that booze that way.

what do you want me to do?

I can't lock the gates, and they're got the police on their side.

unbelievable, hold on. Cassandra, I need 200 teachers at the Cotesworth hotel right now. I need a full picket(示威).

200? I don't know if we can get that

I don't want to hear it. just get it done. I don't give a fuck if they're teachers or not, frankly(坦率地，直率地；（表示直言）老实说). just get me 200 bodies. you know, call the teamsters(卡车驾驶员), maybe they'll help us. we'll give them glasses if we have to. tell the guys to look smart.

Charlie, get off the phone. I need signs right now, at least a hundred.

you know what? let them set it up, it's actually(实际上，事实上；（用于开始新话题）其实；竟然，居然) better for us that way. this way they can't hide for us.

you've put me in a terrible situation.

thank you very much for all your help. much appreciate(欣赏，鉴赏；理解，明白；感谢，感激).

here we got the signs right here, let's hand them out fast. everybody single file right down the street. this way, that way, ok?

well, at least he spelled it right.

teachers protesting(（公开）反对，抗议；坚决表示) the education reform and achievement act have descended(出身于……的；从一个祖先传下来的) upon the hotel Cotesworth in Washington, D.C. union lobbyist Martin Spinell organized the demonstration(演示，展示；游行，示威；证实；表达，表露).

Teachers deserve respect.

now. I knew you'd show up. you bring your beautiful wife of yours? hello...

Pleasure, thank you for coming...

come on in. the drinks are on the house. 

Felicity(极乐，幸福；恰当).

Spinella got us shut out by the union. so we had to have the party out here on the steps. I'll take you up to a bar right now. thank you for coming.

thank you, welcome.

teachers yes. unions, yes.

thanks again so much for coming.

Adam's here.

you came.

looks wonderful.

you're going to have to move over, because I have to serve this wonderful couple myself.

this is fabulous(极好的，绝妙的；非凡的，巨大的，惊人的；虚构的，传说的). only Claire could've thought of this.

I don't suppose(推断，料想，猜想；假设) you have anyting single-malt back there.

Frank, it's worth every penny to see you on key duty.

well, then don't you think this is worth just a few extra pennies?

oh, let's break out the checkbook, Charles.

did you RSVP?

I assumed(假定，假设，认为；装出) it didn't matter.

it doesn't.

I'm glad you're here.

when I haerd your message.

you know I shouldn't have left that, Adam.

why not?

maybe we should talk at some point.

make that check with a lot of zeros, won't you?

there we are.

cheers.

I'm goint to ask a huge favor of you since you're here.

you want to put me to work.

yes, please.

my pleasure.

come.

so these are some wonderful photographs by an amazing photographer.

Gillian. 

Adam Galloway. nict to meet you. and this is the photographer(摄影师) himself.

Freddie. I just wanted to thank you so much. such a success.

I didn't know he was coming.

well, guess what I got.

another check from the Holburns for 60,000. come on, praise me like you should.

if Frank Underwood and the United States Congress...

hi, my name is Zoe Barnes. I'm with Slugline.

dismantle(拆开，拆卸；废除，取消；去掉……的覆盖物) the right of the American teacher?

unions yes, teachers yes.

hi, why do you protest here?

and congress has to take this seriously.

we're here for the teachers. we're here.

thank you, thank you.

we're not asking for the world. and congress needs to step up and get this done.

excuse me(失陪).

that dress looks familar.

it's the one I wore to the symphony.

oh, yes, mutual(相互的，彼此的；共同的) admiration society.

that's right. 

so what do you have for me?

what do you mean?

well, you're surrounded by Washington's elite(权力集团，上层人士；尖子，精英). are you saying you've overheard nothing. that could be useful to either of us?

I'm covering the protest.

the rest of the world is covering the protest. you may not have noticed, but you're the only journalist inside the party. I've been feeding you plenty. information is two-way street, Miss Barnes.

hello,

Claire, this is Zoe Barnes. you met her one night at the house.

yes, I remember.

you work for the herald, right?

not anymore, I actually work at Slugline now.

I've heard of it. you read it, didn't you, Francis?

religiously(认真地，审慎地；与宗教信仰有关地，虔诚地).

well, you seem like a very ambitious young woman. I like that.

Doing my beat.

it's good to see you again. please enjoy yourself.

I will, thank you.

take care, Miss Barnes.

sincerely(由衷地，真诚地).

and she looks gorgeous(美丽动人的；令人愉快的；绚丽的，华丽的). but what really she's thinking, when can I go the fuch home?

I'm off.(我要走了)

already?(这么早要走？)

I've done my duty, I believe. oh, you know me. always have to be the first to leave a party.

how much did you made?

750,000, 80 of that was your photographs.

Fantastic.

write a check for 250, we'll break a million.

haha, nice try.

thank you for coming. and everything that you did.

call me sometime.

I will.

so what does a clean water gala have to do with teachers' unions?

well, we have over 50 members of congress gathered in one place. but the fact that these members of congress are promoting(促进，提倡；升职，晋升) pouring money out of the country, while neglecting(疏忽，忽视；忽略 | n. 疏忽，忽视；怠慢) their teachers at home is precisely(精确地，准确地；恰好，正是（表示强调）) the problem.

but this is private money. not public tax dollars, so...

but we're not protesting the cause. we're protesting the congressmen and women themselves.

are thest even teachers picketing?

well, sure, some of them and some of them are people in... 

excuse me.

Frank, what are you ... 

don't take the food. we'll feed you later.

Marty, you know that old saying, the most dangerous spot in the world is to come between a teamster and free food.

don't take the food. we're feeding you later.

I'll take it.

she'll take it. who else is hungry?

there you go, pass it back.

plenty more coming, guys.

I know you've all been out here for hours.

thank you, Freddy. the best ribs in D.C.

Marty, come on, you said you piece, you got to on the news. come and enjoy yourself.

I respect you, Claire. you know I can't do that.

Doesn't matter what side you're on. everybody's got to eat.

you can have a plate of ribs. yes, you can, come on.

I can't, thank you, Claire, but I cannot. thank you.

Freddy's, you should go to freddy's.

several dozen union sympathizers(同情者；支持者) led by labor(劳动；工作；劳工；分娩) lobbyist Martin Spinella attempted to disrupt(中断，扰乱；彻底改变（某物）的结构) the gala.

they need to step up(提高；增加；走近) to the plate and take care of our teachers and our children.

the protest dissipated(浪费；使…消散 | vi. 驱散；放荡) when fundraiser attendees(出席者；在场者) offer food and drink to picketers.

turn it off.

it is unclear whether the protest will continue.

what now?

call the union leadership and the chapter president. see if they're ready to pull the trigger(（枪械等的）扳机). if they are, we strike at midnight tomorrow.

you were extraordinary(异乎寻常的，令人惊奇的；非凡的，卓越的；).

tomorrow, people who weren't there are gonna lie and say they were.

what are you reading?

clean water flushes unions.

she can write.

she can.

and you can raise money.

always for a good cause.

thank you.

wait in the car, please.

hold on, I know who that is. hello, Peter.

I am starving(（使）挨饿，饿死；使极其缺乏，需要), I forgot to eat. would you like something, Peter.

no, thanks.

you should eat.

don't fight, she'll win.

I will. 

okay, yes.

you want some coffee.

yes, thanks.

do you have any children?

Two, a son and a daughter.

married?

divorced(离婚的；脱离……的).

what are their name, your kids?

um, sarah, she's 11, and kevin is eight.

do you have any picture?

fuck, I lost my phone. I'm sorry, I should.. uh I gotta go.

Peter, sit down. you're enjoy your sandwich, have some coffee, and stay the night. milk and surgar?

black.

some fresh towels(毛巾，抹布). there should be soap and toothpaste. everything you need in the bathroom.

thank you so much for doing this.

oh, it's nothing, sleep well.

what's going on, peter? talk to me.

you think fresh towels changes anything?

changes what?

the shipyard. If I was home and you pulled that shit, I'd beat the fuck out of you.(我一定打死你) I would crack(破裂，裂开；崩溃，垮掉) your skull(颅骨，头骨) on the pavement(人行道). that's why I came over here today, to fuck you un for what you made me do. I don't care how nice you're being to me. I don't give a shit.(我才不管) I'm gonna wake up tomorrow and all these people, all my friends, are still fucked. and I'm still fucked, you fucked all of us. but I'm gotta get blamed(责怪，归咎于；怨，怪) for it. so now I have to carry that weight on my shoulders. you fuck me, Frank. I shouldn't have let you do it. but I did.

are you donw now? get up.

no.

I said get up. and follow me, now.

get in, take off your clothes and get in. do it now.

there was a DNC meeting earlier this week. about the governor race. your name came up as someone we might want to run.

Adpirin, go ahead.

everyone in that room wanted to cross you off the list. I said no, I stuck(粘，贴；把……放（某处）) up for you. I said, 'Peter Russo, he's got potential(潜在的，可能的), he's young, he's capable, he's going places.(他有发展)' I made them keep you in contention(目录；所含物，容纳的东西). you are still on the list. you show up at my house in the middle of the night. drunk, to whine(嘎吱声，吱吱声；抱怨，嘀咕；哀鸣), to try to shift the blame on me, instad of taking responsibility for yourself and your own actioins. maybe they were right in that meeting. maybe you are worthless. I'm the only person who believes in you, Peter. but maybe that's one too many. the hot water will open up yuur capillaries([解剖]毛细血管；微血管). the aspirin you just took will make your blood thinner(油漆的）稀释剂，冲淡剂). it's up to you, Peter. oh, and if you do decide to take the coward's(胆小鬼，懦夫) way out. cut along the tracks, not across them. that's a rookie(新手；（第一年参加比赛的）新队员) mistake.

morning.

morning.

you need a lift to the hill?

I should go home and change my clothes.

no, no, we'll drop you, want some coffee?

Frank?

one month, one month sober.

I can give you that.

not for me, for you.

has the seed(种子，籽；) been planted? only Peter can answer that question. he has a choice, will he wither(（使）枯萎，（使）干枯；衰弱) or will he thrive(茁壮成长，兴旺，繁荣)? only time will tell.

### chapter 6

I personally have very little sympathy for the teachers. we're over three weeks into this strike. it's costing the country billion of dollars, and instead of offering solutions. there is a big difference between taking a stand and sitting on your hands.

I don't know whether to call it cowardice(怯懦，胆小).

it's his agenda, and the problem is that he stole(偷窃，盗窃) sound, conservative(保守的；保守派的) ideas. the only smart thing he's done is lift his platform from the Republican platform(党章).

I admit it, Linda. this got away from me. but we can't turn back time. we have to hold our ground.

while our approval(称许，赞成；批准，许可) ratings continue to nosedive(暴跌；（飞机）俯冲；急剧恶化)?

Spinella ans I work together for years on dozens of labor-related bills. I thought he'd be reasonable.

you were wrong about that.

well, I didn't think he'd be insane(疯癫的，精神失常的；蠢极的，荒唐的) enough to go on strike, and I didn't think the strike would last this long.

so you've been wrong twice about this. why should I believe you're right about holding out?

we threatened(威胁，恐吓；危及，对……构成威胁；预示凶兆，有……危险) collective bargaining in order to get performance standards and charter funding. that's the deal that we made, we took that stand. we lay down now, we lost it all. there'll be no reform, just an empty bill.

I understand the logic, Frank. but we're in damage control now.

we can't close one wound(创伤，伤口) by opening another.

but we're the Democrats. we're the ones who are supposed to be defending the teachers.

but you can't have it both ways, Linda. you can't have the reform you want and keep the teachers happy at the same time. you knew that when we started.

ok, then if we have choose, we choose to keep the teachers happy.

that is mistake, linda. we've already crossed the rubicon(卢比孔河（意大利北部河流）).

i'm telling you this, the president wants to change the bill. we should've done it three weeks ago. we didn't. so you have to do it now.

give me more time, linda. please. if I can break this strike, and get everything want in this bill, can we agree that's preferable(更好的，更合适的) to folding?

of course, if we can count on that.

then count on me fot just one more week. if the strike isn't over by then, I'll change the bill.

Frank.

No, one more week, that's all.

this is the worst possible position to be in. if I water down the bill, the president will still see me as a failure. if the strike doesn't end in a week. I forced myself into a corner. only total victory will put me back in his good graces(优美，优雅；文雅，高雅；风度，体面；恩宠，恩典). the alternative(可供选择的事物，替代物) is exile(流放；被流放者，流亡者). which would mean the last five months were for nothing. I canont abide failing back to square one.

Does congressman need me, ma'am?

no, I just was wondering if you wanted a cup of coffee. I just brewed(沏（茶），冲（咖啡）；酿（啤酒）) a fresh pot.

I'm good, ma'am, But thanks.

are you sure?

My shift's(轮班工作的人) done in a couple(两个，几个) hours. I'll be fine.

no, come on, stretch your legs. I won't take no for an answer. what did you do before you joined the leadership detail?

I was a cop(警察；管纱，纬管) here in DC. before that, I was in the Marines, ma'am. thank you.

did you serve overseas?

I did, ma'am. Bahrain, the Afghanistan. served most of my second tour(旅行，旅游；游览) in the Korangal Valley. you wanna know if I killed anyone?

I think I know the answer.

I got a  dinner meeting with Birch. I'll be...

I invited him in for coffee.

well, drink it fast, we leave i five...

get down. stay away from the windows.

stop.

you'll have six of my best men covering you around the clock.

I guess I'm wondering why we didn't at least have one of your best mem covering us now.

He'll be disciplined(惩罚，处分；训练), sir. He shot a gun in a residential(住宅区的，居民区的 ；家庭的) neighborhood.

I want him fired. there will be a full investigation. and we'll take the necessary action.

Steve never would've let this happen.

Is he better yet? because I would feel a lot safer if he was with us.

unfortunately, he won't be coming back, sir.

I thought he just had a gallbladder(胆囊) infection(传染病；感染；玷污，污染).

he did, but they found more. his pancreas(胰腺), stage(阶段，时期) four,

Jesus,

oh, my god, that's awful.

how much longer does he have?

not long, a few weeks. at least that's what his wife told me.

we have to go see him, can you get the information where he is?

of course, I'll make sure you get it right away.

thank you captain.

thank you.

you're welcome.

front door.

yes, sir.

you weapon.

you badge(徽章，奖章；标记，象征) too.

am I suspended(暂停，中止), sir?

you had s suspect(嫌疑犯，可疑分子) on foot, and you fire your gun?

sorry, I realize that...

do you know how this reflects(反射（光、热或声音）；反映，照出) on me? that one of our could be so careless? not only do you abandon(抛弃，遗弃；（因危险）离开，舍弃；中止，不再有) your post(哨岗，哨位) for coffee. you could've killed a bystander(旁观者，局外人). that slug(<非正式>子弹，气枪弹) was found in somebody's front stoop(<美>门廊，门阶). what if it went in their house?

your badge, Meechum.

two reasons, which are really the same reason, I was sick of working for other people. and I knew I could do a better job than my bosses. they keep trying to suppress me, shutting me out. so I said, 'fuck it, I'll do it my way.'

then you just quit?

not like you did. I slaved(苦干，拼命干) away until I lined up the money to start Slugline.

once Slugline gets big enough, what's the plan?

are you gonna sell it like Arianna?

probably, and then who knows? whatever the next adventure(冒险（经历），奇遇) is. Maybe Shanghai.

so I shouldn't expect to have a job in two years?

do you ever wanna have any job for more than two years? what about you? what's your big plan?

uh, I don't know yet.

come on, Slugline is just a setpping stone for you.

you know what? I should take this.

Go, do your thing.

hey, you have proof(证明，证据；检验，证实) Spinell was behind it?

put it in context, three weeks into a national teachers' strike.

at the home of Francis Underwood, who has led the charge on 

there you go, now post that before one of my neighbors calls a local 11:00 hack.

when do I see you next?

I'm background on this, I'm not your source.

you can't talk now.

no.

when?

soon, with bells on.

what about 'more school books, less bricks(砖，砖块)'?

nah, it's too broad. we need a better sound bite. something special. something that points the finger directly at Spinell.

he'll deny any involement.

of course he will. so how do we get around that?

we say he can't control his troops(军队，士兵；部队).

there is no evidence(根据，证明) is was a teacher.

who else could it be?

he's gonna shift(使）移动，（使）转移) blame(责怪，归咎于；怨，怪) for the strike back on congress. no, we need something clear, something clean. something that sticks(粘，贴；铭记在心，经久不忘) in your head.

teachers need a lesson in self-restraint(克制，抑制；控制，限制).

no, you're not hearing me. people like teachers. no, we need something that makes Spinell the villain(反派角色，反面人物；<非正式>罪犯；祸首). his lack of control, his inability(无能).

disorganized labor.

it's disorganized labor, plain(无装饰的，朴素的) and simple. when you've got angry teachers throwing bricks through congressman's windows, you've gotta blame the union leadership.

we'll be beefing up(加强（增援，充实）；补充) the security for the entire leadership(领导，领导地位；领导才能；领导人员，领导层). and I strongly encourage(鼓励，激励；鼓动) Marty Spinell to keep his people in line. this is starting to look like disorganized labor.

do you really think Marty Spinell is to blame?

whether Mr. Spinell is behind this or not, he might wanna tone down the rhetoric(花言巧语，浮夸之词；修辞). before disorganized labor turns into organized crime.

no one can prove anything, so that's the most cogent(有说服力的，令人信服的；清晰的，合乎逻辑的) response.

well, go on TV and say that. you deplore(强烈反对，谴责) violence(暴力，暴行；（言行的）狂暴) in any form. it's congress that should take responsibility. 

I don't want to degenerate(恶化，堕落，退化) to Frank's level.

we need to kill this brick thing. it's districting(使分心，使转移注意力；<古>使困惑，使迷惑) people from the issues.

she's right.

It'll eat up one cycle, and it'll disappear.

no, this story is getting traction(拖，拉，牵引，拉力，牵引力).

support for the strike is dipping(浸，蘸；下降，下沉).

so is the president's approval ratings.

but he gets to say in the oval office another three years, no matter what. we can't afford another three weeks.

when I told the union to strike, I told them to prepare for the long haul(费力前进，艰难地走), all right. their accounts dry up, we keep going. we figure(出现；<美，非正式>认为，估计；理解，弄懂；计算) it out. I'm not going to blink(闪烁；表示惊讶，显出不安；退让，让步) over something like this.

fine, but if we lose the public relations battle, none of that does us any good. Frank wants us on the defensive. I think this story is going to blow over. If I'm wrong, we'll reevaluate(再评估；重新估计). but I wanna give it another day or two first. ok?

hi, Adam.

you all right? I saw the news.

yes, I'm fine.

that's gotta rattle(使）咯咯作响；（车辆） 嘎拉嘎拉地响) the nerves. a brick coming through the window.

it did, some.

so are you staying in the house?

we've got extra security now, so.

well, um, it made me think of you. so I figured(以重要地位）出现；<美，非正式>认为，估计；理解) I'd just check in.

I appreciate that, we still haven't talked, have we?

there's no need to.

I think we should.

here's how I see it. you asked me to come down, I did. we both had ideas about what that could mean. probably very similar ieads. but then you changed your mind. so be it.(顺其自然) there's no reason we can't be in touch or remain friends.

let's not fool ourselves, Adam.

so I won't call again.(我不应该再打电话了吗) done.

I'm not saying that.(我不是那个意思)

what are you saying?

I just called because I care about you. no agenda(待议事项，议事日程；（政治）议题；秘密计划，秘密目标).(没别的意思)

If you wanna talk again, call me. If no, I understand. It's up to you.(都随你)

you think I'm being unreasonable?

I think you're doing whatever it is you need to do, and I'm not gonna question it.

It was sweet of you to call.

listen, you probably need to get back to work, I know I do, I should go.

yeah, ok.

take care.

ok.

Frank, you got a minute?

I'll see you inside.

I wanna be governor, and I want your help. am I still on the short list?

you are.

I haven't had a drink in over a month, I'm clean.

is that because I asked, or because it's what you want?

it was about time I took responsibility for myself.

taking responsibility is one thing, and it's admirable. but running for governor of a major state is a whole other ball game.

let me tell you something, Frank, I got elected congress, cause I seized(抓住，捉住；（用武力）夺取，占领) the moment that opportunity struck. you kept me on that list. I wanna seize that opportunity. If you help me out, I'll give you everything I got.

well, that's all I've been waiting to hear.

all right, I'll tell you what. I need to make some calls, check in with some people. give me a few days, I'll get back to you.

of course.

and Peter, I feel like I've met the real you for the first time just now.

Janet. is this a bad time?

no, not at all. here, take my chair.

oh, no, I'm fine.

I'll take these. thank you.

hello, steve.

these could use some water, I'll be right back.

Francis and I were so upset(不高兴的，心烦意乱的；（肠胃）不适的) when we heard. I'm sorry I haven't come sonner(更快地，更早地).

I didn't want too many people knowing.

yes. Francis wished he could be here. he wants you to know he's praying(祈祷，祷告；渴望) tor you.

couldn't make it,(来不了) huh?

no, there's a big teachers' strike going on right now, and he's been stuck in his office for weeks.

I get it, I saw on the news. the brick.

right.

I told Frank that probably wouldn't have happened if you were there.

no, probably not. I never seen him pray. not in eight years. you said he was praying for me.

you've seen us in church.

yeah, but I never went inside.

they're just gorgeous(美丽动人的；令人愉快的；绚丽的，华丽的). Mrs. Underwood, thank you so much.

please, call me Claire.

I know you got things to do.

of course.

If you need anything at all, call me. you have my cell.

anything at all. and I'm sorry to have surprised you.(很抱歉我贸然而来)

no, it was so nice of you to come. thank you, I know Steve appreciated it.

check this out.

it's foam(泡沫，气泡；泡沫橡胶).

how many of these we have?

200, but I can get more.

get more.

you need to give the teachers the respect they deserve.

we can't back away from this, Marty. we've gotta it head on.

they provoked(激起；挑衅) us.

they were throwing foam. our guys were throwing punches(一拳，一击).

we're gonna come off the bad guys here.

ok, ok, I get it, I get it. but I wanna be smart about this. I wanna do something definitive(最终的，确定的；最好的) that'll put this to bed and get us back on message. 

CNN, one on one, you and Underwood, 8:00 tonight. Frank is excellent in debates(辩论；讨论).

go strong against him. address the brick right to his face. end of story.

Underwood says he's in if you are.

ok, but I want as much prep(准备（preparation）) as possible, ok? I want to run questions. you moderate(普通的，中等的；不偏激的，温和的),(你当中间人) you play Underwood.

wear this one. then come in here, I wanna put powder on you.

well, somebody at the studio can do that.

yes, and they always cake(（用会变干的东西厚厚地）覆盖；（干后）结成硬块) on too much, I'm doing it.

war paint.

how bloddy do you think it'll be?

oh, I think I oughta(应当，应该（=ought to）) be able to dispatch with him easily enough. oh, you remember Peter Russo?

he's doing well, he hasn't had a drink in a month.

oh, good for him, I like him.

oh, good, because he could use your help.

how?

we're running him for governor.

ambitious.

we wanna create job in hid district. it's on the delaware river. I thought we might be able to put a bill together. something with an economic upside.

this has to do with the shipyard closing?

we need the shipbuilders' support for his campaign. you think you might be able to draft a bill that he can sponsor(赞助（活动、节目等）； 为慈善活动捐资)?

I'm really tryint to focus on international projects, Francis.

not domestic(国内的，本国的；家用的，家庭的) legislation.

I understand, but I could really use your help, Claire.

does Catherine Durant still oew us?

when you make someone Secretary of State, they owe you for life.

we're having trouble getting our water filters through Sudanese customs.

I'll call from the car.

tomorrow's fine.

I would have done that anyway.

I know.

I'm ready for the battle. you wanna come watch?

no, you go on ahead.

oh, come on. watch me put the final nail(钉子；指甲，趾甲) in Spinell's coffin.(棺材) it'll be fun.

Marty.

Frank.

congressman, would you like to respond to that?

yes, I would. twoo billion dollars for taxpayer's money being wasted.

and congress should be ashamed(感到羞愧，感到羞耻；羞于（做某事）) of itself for that, Frank.

oh, what? did congress force the teachers to go on strike, Marty? no, we didn't.

really, Frank? when you threaten teachers' ability to negotiate(谈判，磋商，洽谈；商定) as a union, when you threaten their job security, you threaten their livelihood(生计，营生), of course you force them to strike.

oh, and did we also force them to start throwing bricks at people's house?

you know what? I'm really glas you brought that up, because you know there's absolutely no proof that that incident(事件，事故) had anything to do with this strike. and I wanna take the opportunity to say publicly that we categorically(绝对的) condemn(谴责，严厉指责) any use of violence(暴力，暴行) whatsoerver(暴力，暴行) or intimidation(恫吓，威胁).

what you're saying essentially(本质上，根本上；大体上，基本上) is that you can't control you own people.

that is not what I'm saying.

that is what you're saying. you're disorganized. disorganized labor.

you can keep trotting out (trot sth out 重复) that phrase all you like. but you know what I'd like to do, Frank? I would like to get back to the issue here of educating our children. and the fact that congress is not living up to(live up to 符合做到无愧于) their commitment(忠诚，献身；承诺，保证；奉献).

well, you know what I would like?

what?

an apology. if not to me, then to my wife. when that brick came through our window, it was terrifying(吓人的，令人害怕的). she's standing right over there.

Claire? we need camera to on the wife.

now, why don't you look her in the eye, and tell her that your people had nothing to do with that brick?

are you serious?

yes.

okay. Mrs. Underwood, Claire. I'm sincerely(由衷地，真诚地) sorry that you had to go through that ordeal(磨难，严峻考验), truly. and it actually sickens me that someone made you feel unsafe in your own home. and I give you my word that to the best of my knowledge, none of our people had anything to do with it. but you know what sicken me more? that right now, your husband is using you as a prop(（戏剧或电影中的）道具) on national television to try and win a debate. So, I think you're the one that owes your wife an apology, Frank. and when you're done apologizing, can we please get back to the issue here of educating our children?

no, you've got this wrong, Marty. there's no 'you' and 'I' in education. well, I mean yes, there's the letters. U and I are in the work education. but education with a capital E. you know what I'm talking about.

I don't think I do.

yes, you do, Marty. U and I, education.

so, what, we're gonna waste the rest of this debate naming all the vowel(元音，母音；元音字母，母音字母) in... 

I'm happy to play the vowel game. you wanna play the game with me? all right, U think I O U a apology. but no no no, U O I...

interesting, you left out E for 'education'

so let defecation(排便；澄清，净化)

you like Sesame(芝麻，胡麻) Street so much? why don't you give the kids the money they deserve?

what I'm trying to say about education... I guess school's still in session. I guess you schooled me there, Marty. let's nove on, please.

humor(幽默，诙谐；心情) aside. there are more important issues out there.

I had no intention of bringing you into this. it's wasn't part of a plan. I would've told you if it was.

I know.

the idea just struck me, and I went with it.

I don't mind that you improvised(即兴表演，即兴创作；临时做，临时凑成). I just wish you'd done it better.

congressman Underwood says he got, quote, 'schooled' by AFT spokesman and chief strategist(战略家；军事家), Martin Spinell. during a debate last night on this network. in the past 12 hours, reruns of the gaffe(失态；过失) have played non-stop on TV news programs and the Internet. A youtobe clip(（电影、电视节目等的）片段) set to techno music has more than 300,000 hits and spawned(产卵；引发，促生；大量生产) dozens of other spoofs(滑稽模仿；行骗；戏弄；讽刺性文章或节目).

that was as clumsy(笨拙的，不灵活的；不得体的；难处理的) as the Lee Harvey Oswald prison transfer. what was he thinking?

just give me one second. there's a deli(熟食店；[食品]熟食品（等于 delicatessen）). down the street.

Patti, thanks for coming. sit down, you want some coffee?

no, thanks, I'm good.

hey, did you see Bill Maher last night?

no, I didn't.

oh, it was about the CNN thing. I have to admit, Frank, it was kinda funny.

well, I'll have to catch a rerun(重播).

how are you doning? you holding up all right with the strike?

let's talk about Pennsylvania. I have your candidate(候选人，申请者). Peter Russo, first congressional district.

we crossed him off.

I know, it's mistake. he's young, he's handsome, he's bright(明亮的；鲜艳的；聪明的；欢快的).

nobody knows who he is outside of Philadelphia(费城). there's no donor(捐献者，捐赠者) base, no infrastructure(下面结构；永久性军事设施；基础设施，基础建设).

you start me off with funding from the DNC and I'll raise an army around this guy. I will personally oversee(监督) his campaign.

is that the best we can do?

what's better than a blank slate(板岩，石板；（盖房顶的）石板) in the right hands?

congressman, do you have a moment?

thank you, Patti.

have him call me.

I will.

Ed? please.

what is going on? 

I'm taking care of it.

one second, sir, please.

all right, make it fast, Meechum.

it's not easy for me to ask this, but I was wondering if you could put in a good word with my boss.

a good word?

they're going to discharge(释放，允许……离开；解雇) me, sir.

I messed(弄脏，弄乱；玩弄) up, I'm fully aware(知道的，明白的；察觉到的). but my job, it means everything to me. and I know a good word form you would 

look, I have nothing against you personally, Meechum. but I can't get involved in these sort of affairs. there's protocols and rules.

sir, please, if you spoke to Cardiff.

there's nothing that I can do.

if anyone can convince(使确信，使信服；说服，劝服) the captain, it would be you, congressman.

I'm sorry, I wish you all the best, Meechum.
 
Doug, what did Barnney Hull say?

that we'd be the first to know. I can't believe there hasn't been a single 911 call.

there's been plenty. It's just not the sort we're after. we got that kid in Atlanta.

no, it's got to be here, I can't be getting on a plane. it looks to opportunitic.

maybe if we open it up a little bit.

no, we cannot lower our standards. we just have to be patient(能忍耐的，有耐心的).

new rule, now that the debate's over, Frank Underwood has to tell us what the hell(地狱；苦难的经历) that was. seriously, congressman, was that a joke? I haven't seen something just lay there like that, since, uh, I gotta go all the way back to my prom(<美>（美国高中生在学年末举行的）正式舞会) night. can we just settle(结束（争论、争端等），解决（分歧、纠纷等）) the strike please? teachers have been out of the classroom for so long. middle school are starting to have sex with each other.

enough. I don't know why you had it on in the first place.

I love you, Francis.

I know.

we should say that more often to each other.

I need to clear my head.

north and east of the airport. I'm gonna need that in time for that meeting.

Peter, let's talk. so, I've spoken to Patricia Whittaker. she's on borad.(她同意了) you'll be getting four million in start-up funding from the DNC. I'll pick the team. you announce in Augest. but the campaign starts today.

are you ready?

I've already put together a platform. it's mostly broad stokes, but we can hone(磨练，训练（尤指技艺）；磨（刀、剑等）) it.

good, the first thing we need to addrss is your sobriety.

oh, you don't need to worry about that.

have you been going to meetings?

you mean AA?

yes.

that's not really my thing.

if you want my help. then going to meetings is my one requirement.

I know I had a problem, Frank. I accept that, and I've taken responsibility for that, but I don't think going to meetings is necessary.

you cannot white-knuckle(神经紧张的；引起神经紧张的) your recovery, Peter.

this campaign will be the hardest thing you've ever done in your life.

I realize that, I'm prepared fot that.

you think you are, but we can't take any chances. the party's investing in you. I need to make sure you're investing in yourself.

all right. I'll do whatever I have to do.

good, you'll srat tomorrow morning, Doug will take you.

Stamper?

he's been sober 14 years.

Doug has a drinking problem?

had, not anymore, he'll be your sponsor(赞助者，赞助商；). in the meantime, I want you to meet my wife, Claire. she runs the clean water initiative(措施，倡议；主动性，积极性；主动权). she's expecting you so clear your schedule and head over there now.

Frank, thank you for believing in me.

you're gonna make a greate candidate, Peter.

the shipyard closing frees up 1,100 acres(英亩；<非正式>大片，大量) of federal land. our goal is to pass a watershed(美）流域；分水岭；集水区；转折点) act for the Delaware River. we develop the land in an environmenttally-responsible way, create jobs in the process.

how many jobs?

thousands. we're aiming for the 200-million mark. we got a lot of work to do.

you do, but we can start with the congressman whose districts fall within the wastershed.

do you have a draft of the bill you can show me? we haven't sponsored(赞助（活动、节目等）； 为慈善活动捐资，为义赛捐款；倡议，提交（法案等）) any environmenttal legislation.

this is steve, don't call, please visit.

we'll draft it in consultation(商讨，磋商，磋商会议；咨询，就诊；查找，查阅) with your staff. Gillian will be the point person on our end. I don't have any legislation experience.

I'll help you.

when do we start?

we just did, will you introduce him to the reserch team?

I'll be there in one second.

sure.

so tomorrow ok?

Mr. president.

I want it over. as soon as possible.

gut(取出……的内脏（以便烹饪）；毁坏（建筑物）的内部) the bill, Frank. do whatever's necessary to end this.

Mr. president, if we give in now, the public won't credit(相信，信任；认为是……的功劳，给予承认) you with a victory. not even a hollow(虚伪的，不真诚的；无用的) one. they'll chalk(用粉笔写（或画）；用粉笔做记号) it up as a colossal(巨大的，庞大的；异常的，非常的) defeat.

well, that's on you, Frank. you let this situation devolve(转移；移交；使滚下) to where it is. I've alreay been blamed for the largest teachers' strike in US history. I won't be held(握住（hold的过去分词）；举起,抬起) accountable(负有责任的，应作解释的；可理解的) for it dragging on months and months.

Mr. president, we have to end this strike on your terms(方面，角度). not anyone else's.

how? by debating Marty Spinell on CNN?

sir, you have placed your faith in me thus(<正式>因此；<正式>这样，以此种方式；<正式>到如此程度) far, I would ask that you continue to do so.

whatever you're doing, Frank, isn't working. so I'm stepping in, gut the bill, like Linda said.

no, I'm sorry, Mr. precedent, but I'll not do that.

are you letting pride cloud your judgment, Frank?

respectfully(尊敬地), sir, you're allowing fear to cloud yours.

not an easy thing to say no to the most powerful man in the free world. but sometimes the only way to gain your superior's respect is to defy(违抗，不服从；挑战，激) him.

what do we have on the schedule, linda?

you're meeting with the...

thank you, Mr. precedent.

do you have my briefing?

right here.

good, let's look it over.

hi, how'd it go with Peter?

it went well.

is he game?(他投入吗？)

completely.

uh, thank you, that's a big weight off my shoulders.

you sound tired.

tired, impatient(不耐烦的，没有耐心的；迫不及待的).

what can I do?

nothing, this one's up to fate(命运).

I don't like when we leave things to fate.

neither do I.

does that mean I'm gonna have the bed to myself tonight?

probably.

can't Doug man(在……岗位上工作，操纵（机器等），配备（人员）) the fort(堡垒，要塞；<美>兵营，军营；<史>边界贸易站)?

well, he could, but I'd just toss(扔，抛，掷；向后甩) and turn.(辗转反侧) if I'm not gonna sleep, I might as well not sleep here.

well, I'll leave the ringer on. call me if you want company(<古>结交，交往；<古>陪伴).

I will, good night.

good night.

you should go home, I can take it from here.

vigilance(警戒，警觉；失眠症), it's good for the soul(灵魂；心灵).

10-59, corner of 16th and Q. 10-59

what that?

Disorderly conduct(行为，举止；经营方式，管理方法). (妨碍治安)

do you believe in karma((印度教和佛教信仰的）羯磨，业（认为今世的行为会影响来世))? (你相信有因果报应吗？)

absolutely not.

well, I do. at least tonight. get captain Cardiff on the phone. let's do something about Meechum.

what?

get him his job back.

he fired his weapon.

he overreacted.

Cardiff, on the phone, now.

Nancy, give me captain Cardiff, please. 

we might as well do one productive(有效益的，富有成效的) thing while we wait. it requires very little of me. and will mean the world to him. so it's a very inexpensive investment.

Hello, sir, this is Doug Stamper. I have Francis Underwood for you. 

I got him on.

captain, I know it'a late, but I'd like to talk to you about Edward Meechum.

good morning, gentleman.

thank you.

are you hungry?

you have any trouble getting in?

no, they made me put it though the x-ray machine twice. so I hope it didn't overcook it.

Frank, you always pay too much, this is way too much.

for the inconvenience.

you know, 20 years you been coming to my joint. this the first time I been to yours.

what do you think?

I could get used to it.

well, you're welcome any time.

thank you Freddy.

always Frank.

got a ... 446 3rd street, that's a drive-by shooting. 

get details.

sir, I want to thank you fot talking to the caption. he told me you called, and I can't tell you how grateful I am.

I want you to listen very closely to what I'm about to say. from this moment on, you are a rock. you absorb(吸收；使并入，纳入；同化) nothing, you say nothing. and nothing breaks you, is that clear?

yes, sir.

welcome back.

Steve?

I'll leave you be.

where, uh, where's Janet?

she's been here every day for the last few weeks. I told her go home, get some rest.

well, is everything ok? you text said it was important.

I don't know how to put this, the thing is I've been thinking a lot. about my life, about the things I haven't done. things I haven't said. I hate your husband.

a lot of people do.

the past eight yeas, I wantched over him, but it wasn't him I was watching, and every time I saw you. every time I hear you voice, all I could think to myself was, 'Jesus, what I wouldn't give' I can't tell you how many times I thought about that.

you know what Francis said to me when he proposed(提议；计划)? (求婚)

I remember his exact words. he said, 'Claire, if all you want is happiness, say no, I'm not gonna give you a couple of kis and count the days until retirement. I promise you freedom from that, I promise you'll never be bored.' you know he was the only man... and there was a lot of others who proposed. but he was the only one who understood me. he didn't put me on some pedestal(受人尊敬的地位). he knew that I didn't want to be adored(非常喜欢，热爱；爱慕，疼爱；崇拜，崇敬) or coddled(娇养；溺爱). so he took my hand and he put a ring on it. because he knew I'd say hes. he's a man who knows how to take what he wants.

is that what you wanted it? is that the way you wanted it?

stop, stop, please, please, stop. don't.

you told me your truth. now you know mine.

hey, it's Peter. I don't expect you to call me back, but I wanted to let you know I stopped drinking last night. and I went to my first AA meeting this morning. um, I supposed to reach out and make amends(修改，修订；纠正，改正) to those I've hurt. but I guess the real reason I called you is just to say I love you and I miss you. I hope you're well.

this is work, not play.

then why'd you bother(费心；（使）烦恼，（使）担心) coming over?

I was hoping you'd answer the door naked(使某人裸露).

that would be play.

that would be work with a view.

sorry to disappoint(失望).

how many characters in a tweet?

140, type this, let me know where you land. 'eight-year-old Washington DC boy killed by a stray(走失，迷路；走神) bullet(子弹，弹丸) in gandland(黑社会；充斥盗匪的地区) shoot-out.'

61 characters left.

should have been in school?

30 left.

Spinell to blame?

press send.

now give me a name, details.

Tyler Davis, Third grader at Vernon Baker Elementary(简单的，基本的；基础的，初级的；小学的). shot outside his home in sourtheast just before non today.

sent, where are you going?

to see the mother.

you don't wanna...?

there's work to do. I'll see you later tonight.

Tyler never did anything wrong. he was a good boy. everybody loved him.

it's ok, if Tyler's school had been in session, this senseless(愚蠢的；无知觉的；无意识的) killing would have never taken place. we need end the strike now and get all our children back in school where they belong before we risk another death like this. so, Mr. Spinell, I am headed to the Capitol right now, and I will remain there until you are ready to meet and talk. so that we can end this pointless strike. thank you for all coming.

let's go back inside.

Mr. Spinell one question. Mr. Spinell is not to make a comment at this time. no comment. no comment.

thank you.

Frank. so? you said you wanted to talk to me? you said you wanted to work out a compromise(折中，妥协；妥协方案，折中办法)?

I lied.

excuse me?

I have no intention(意图，目的，打算；愈合；意念) of working out a compromise.

so then why the fuck are we here, Frank?

what the hell's(地狱；苦难的经历) the matter with you? you think this is some kind of games?

no.

there are real people with families to feed. would you plese stop that?

stop what?

in five seconds, I'm out of here.

1,2,3,4

goodbay Frank.

you know the difference between you and me, Marty.

what?

I'm a white-tash(小胡子) cracker(裂缝，裂口) form a white-trash town that no one would even bother(费心；（使）烦恼，) to piss(撒尿，小便) on. but here's the difference. I've made something of myself. I have the keys to the Capitol, people respect me. but you, you are still nothing. you're just an uppity(傲慢的；自负的；不易控制的) dago(外国佬（对意大利人、西班牙人、葡萄牙人的蔑称）) in an expensive suit turning tricks(花招，诡计) for the union. nobody repects the unions anymore, Marty. they are dying. and not one respects you. the most you'll ever make of yourself is blowing men like me. men with real power.

yes, I can smell the cock(阴茎，鸡巴；龙头) on your breath from here. you think you can get under my skin? I know I can. kiss my ass, Frank.

you can't afford to walk out.

watch me.

I've got a dead. underprivileged(贫困的，社会地位低下的，弱势的) kid in my pocket.

what do you have?

I have two million honorable teachers.

fair enough. but I got something even better. go ahead, open it.

ok, I'll play your game.

you're an idiot.

September threw it.

you're full of shit.

oh, no, Stamper threw the brick. and I made sure Claire distracted(使分心，使转移注意力；<古>使困惑，使迷惑) my security.

are you kidding me?

and to think you wanted me to apologize to my wife.

you would do something that low, Frank?

I arranged the brick, Marty. just like I arranged this meeting this afternoon.

back off, Frank.

why don't you just get down on your kness where you really belong?

back off, Frank.

because the only thing you're gonna get form me is come on your...

fuck you.

everything ok in there?

look, I'll tell them you provoked(激起；挑衅) me. I'll tell them that you threw the brick yourself.

and who's gonna to believe you? you just assaulted(武力攻击，袭击) a United States congressman. whick his a felony(重罪). but I'm not gonna press charges(控告，指控), Marty. because the strike ends now.

you think it'll leave a scar(伤疤，疤痕)?

I have a thick(厚的，粗的) skin.

the next time you ask me to invite someone in for coffee, will you please make sure no guns go off?

I'll do my best.

I saw Steve again today.

how is he?

in a lot of pain.

should I go to see him?

I don't think you need to. when he dies, we'll pay for his funeral(葬礼，丧礼).

you don't need to take it.

no, I'm done with work today.

### chapter 7

vice president Matthews.

Bob. 

Mr. vice president.

Mr. vice president.

Frank.

Sir, I'm gonna need you to stand on your mark.

I'm fine right here.

so they pull me from the car. both legs broken, fractured(破裂，折断；) skull(颅骨，头骨；). punctured(刺穿) lung(肺). my heart stops, two full minutes. they're pumping(抽水机，泵) my chest(胸部，胸膛), nothing. they grab(攫取，抓住) the defibrillators(电震发生器), Pachpoom(嘭). nothing. third time. the pistons(活塞) start firing. doctors tell me  it's a miracle I'm alive. but seriously, you talk about a wake-up call from God. you don't get to come back from the dead twice.

The president of the United States.

good morning. the education reform and achievement act that I sign into law today. will affect every child and parent in the United States. will ensure a better educated workforce(劳动力，劳动人口) for decades to come. and will reinforce(加强，强化) America's preeminence(卓越；杰出) as an intellectual(智力的，理智的) superpower. and I'd like to thank one man in particular who never lost sight of the larger mission(使命，重要任务；职责，天职), who spearheaded(矛头；先锋；先锋部队 | vt. 带头；做先锋) this bill from the begining, and that's the congressman Frank Underwood.

Invited guests, please join us in the east room for refreshments(点心；[食品] 茶点；小吃). media, we will convene(召集，集合，开会；传唤) immediately in the briefing room for our conference.

Linda, thank you so much for all the help you gave us in getting this bill passed.

no, thank you, Frank, this was your baby from the begining. I appreciate you standing your ground on this one, Frank. I'm smart enough to admit when I was wrong. I was just telling Frank we should set up a weekly. so he can keep us up to date on what's going on in the house.

that sounds like a great idea.

congratulations sir.

Garrett, I was wondering if we could talk for a few minutes. that thing I mentioned a couple of weeks ago about the job tax credit...

I've been giving it a lot of thought, Jim. and I think it's a good idea, but I'd like to look over my notes first, If you don't mind, so I can talk about it intelligently with you.

sir, you have your call with the Prime Minister.

busy man.

yes, he is.

Frank, I hear that you are heading up the special election in my home state.

Peter Russo. we're trying to keep that under the radar until he offically announces. in face, we're not even working out of my office until that happens.

where are you working from?

the basement of my house.

any reason why the DNC didn't ask my advice on the candidate?

well, I thought they passed it by you, or Linda did.

nobody did. 

well, that is unacceptable.

and I have major doubts(怀疑，不确定；不信任) about Russo.

his inexpreience?

yes, and he's urban(城市；市区)-based. I don't know if he'll connect with rural(农村的，乡村的；) voters.

look, frankly, that's one of my concerns(担心，忧虑；使人担忧的事物) as well. we're working on that. but if you were to come out and stump(（政治家在选举前的）巡回演说) with him, that would go a long way to convince(使确信，使信服；说服，劝服)...

Frank, I can't stump for somebody I don't believe in.

it's early days yet, I'd ask you to keep an open mind. and let me know if you want to set up a meeting between two of you. because, sir, an endorsement(背书，票据签字；（驾驶执照上的）违章记录) from you would be a big coup(政变；成功之举，妙计) of him. it's good to see you, mr. vice president.

congressman Underwood?

miss Barnes, I was under the impression(印象，感想；影响) you didn't wanna cover the white house. Slugline just got access yesterday.

I know.

I left the herald because I didn't wanna cover the white house, and now here I am.

access isn't the same as a ball and chain. and I only gonna see you at bill signings now. I haven't heard from you in three weeks.

insecurity bores(使厌烦，使讨厌；钻（孔），挖（洞）；盯着看) me.

I feel the same way about condescension(屈尊；傲慢态度；纡尊降贵（表不满）).

your place, this evening, and I'll text you when I'm about to arrive.

what if I'm busy?

you're just afraid I'm gonna stand you up again.(放你鸽子)

I just wanna make sure it's worth my while(一段时间；同时；<文>在此期间).

it'll be worth you while. this's make up for last time. It's a piece of history. from the precedent's hand to yours.

you believe in all that higher-power stuff they talk about in the room?

I believe there are things beyond our control. who or what's controlling them.. that I don't know.

I don't believe in God. Heaven, Hell, none of it.

too much catholic(广泛的，包罗万象的；天主教的) school?

maybe.

I'm not saying you have to believe in God, Peter. or anything, for that matter. but you shouldn't rule(判定，裁定) anything out.

I should go.

It's on the campaign.

our crosstabs(交叉表) show 81% of likely votes are willing to consider a recovering alcoholic(酗酒者，酒鬼). now those numbres dip a little when you introduce cocaine, but not by much.

Randy?

it's a risk, but it'll make waves. free coverage across the board. the narrative(记叙文，叙述；叙事技巧) has to be redemption(（基督教指耶稣的）救赎，赎罪). A Phoenix frome the ashes(灰烬，废墟). 

well, let's not focus on the ashes. we don't want people to think Peter was a disaster(灾难，灾害；祸患，灾难性事物；彻底的失败).

no, no, we focus on the positive. a 'Fresh start' and a 'Clean start', both did well in focus groups.

clean start sounds too much like clean slate.(清白的记录)

I like fresh start.

yeah, I do too.

how we doing on the fund-raising?

the alcoholic thing will turn off some of the in-state donors(捐献者，捐赠者). but it's an off-year(非大选年) election. we can hit up the usual suspects(猜想，认为) in new york and california.

walter, how vulnerable(身体或精神）脆弱的，易受伤的) ar we?

I'm not prepared to answer that question. Peter and I have yet to perform the holy sacrament(圣礼；圣餐；神秘的事物) of confession(供认，供状；承认，坦白；忏悔，告解；声明，告白).

we still need to address the shipyard closing too.

Claire's helping us with that.

we're push a bill called the Delaware river watershed act. and I think it's going to bring about 5,000 jobs into Peter's district over the next three years. we have a draft of the bill completed. Peter's in the process of securing(使安全，保护；缚牢，将（某物）固定) cosponsors(共同赞助者；共同主办人). and who have you called, by the way.

I have some e-mails out, but most of them wanna see a bill first.

have you set up a meeting with the shipbuilders yet?

I don't think they're gonna back me.

that's the entire point of the bill, Peter.

well, if I go to them and I say. 'hey, some of you maybe will get your jobs back, not tomorrow, but three years from now. and most of you won't be getting your jobs back anyway...'

all right, let's put a pin in this until we get more sponsors. I have to go to the office. I'll catch you all later.

ok, let's move on to our field plan. I want to go through the regions one by one...

Francis, we spent six weeks on that bill.

It'll be fine. He'll come around.

I'll see you later tonight?

I have appointment.

so I won't see you until morning.

I'll be back before you get up.

I appreciate your taking the time today, sir.

did you get that tax credit memo the economic reserch team put together?

you didn't ask me here to talk about memos.

I know small talk when I hear it, Linda.

the president has asked that you take a step back from Pennsylvania. you've been taking a lot of trips there, meeting with legislators(立法者)

it's my home state. there's a job crisis(危机，紧要关头；决定性时刻，关键时刻). 

we can't afford to play favorites. the message is 50 states, one solution. not one state, 50 solutions.

I never expected to be involved in every policy or decision. but I haven't been completely cut out of everything.

we value your input, Mr. vice precedent. but right now, we can't...

don't condescend(屈尊；俯就；（对某人）表现出优越感), Linda. no one even asked me who I thought should fill my seat. why if Frank Underwood leading the charge on that, not me?

that is a DNC issue. we are staying out of it and so should you. and so I'm supposed to just cut ribbons(绶带，丝带；带状物) and go to funerals(葬礼，丧礼).

you knew what you signed up for.

thank you, Mr. vice precedent.

I didn't get my pen.

your pen?

from the bill signing.

oh, we'll see what we can do about that.

I can see your security guy.

Meechum?

he's cute(漂亮的，可爱的).

he'd never go for you.

why not?

you're too intimidating(恫吓，威胁).

he's the one with the gun.

but you're the one with the congressman. we'll talk after.

we'll talk before.

Peter Russo. Pennsylvania's first district, he's gonna run for governor. fill Matthews' seat. It's an exclusive profile(独有的，专用的). with someone no one's ever heard of.

what's the angle?

alcohol, drugs. he's a kid from the streets. I want the profile to come out as soon as he announces. and I'd like it to be kind.

I don't write puff(吹捧文字) pieces.

then get someone else to write it.

I thought you had something for me.

It's too easy for people to link me as your source. It's dangerous.

I don't benefit from handing out headlines to other people.

generosity(慷慨，大方) is its own from of power, Zoe.

step seven.

you always wear your sunglass at night?

how did you fine me?

I figured you had to be in government. I kept googling till I found your picture.

that won't work, what you're doing. it was a one-time deal. you don't get to keep coming back for more.

I'll go to the police. 

they'll laugh in your face, look at you.

if the police won't listen to me, I'll call TV stations. I konw the name...

Douglas Stamper, Peter Russo. Frank Underwood.

you are walking down a road you don't want to walk down. 

please, I won't call anyone. but I need your help. I don't have anywhere to go, I don't have anyone I can call. I've had to do things, and I don't wanna do it anymore.

that'a all I've got right now. find a place to stay and let me know where you are. I'll figure something out.

you hungry?

what's your name?

sapphire(蓝宝石；[宝] 青玉；天蓝色).

no, what's your name?

Rechel.

your ex-wife... anything uncouth(笨拙的；粗野的；不舒适的；陌生的)?

how do you mean?

bondage(奴役，束缚；施虐性行为), orgies(纵欲，放荡), water sports?

no, definitely(肯定地，当然；明确地，确定地) not.

Narcotics?

she wasn't  into that.

not even a little ganga?

okay, once in a blue moon. 

ever with your children?

god, no.

even if front you them?

look, I'm not the world's best dad, but I would never do that.

Fine, Let's move on to prostitution(卖淫；滥用；出卖灵魂).

how long is this gonna take?

until there's nothing I don't know about you.

I wrote all this down.

I've been doing this a long time, congressman. I know when I've scraped(刮，擦；刮去；用工具刮) all the shit off the shoe.

prostitution.

after my divorce(离婚；离婚判决；分开，脱离). I took a trip to Thailand. It was about two weeks. how many women?

10, 15.

I don't konw. it was a bit of a blur.

there were drugs?

uh, yes.

opium(鸦片；起麻木作用的事物，精神鸦片；麻醉剂), speed. some smack.

powder or needles(针数，千针本)?

both.

would any of these women know who you are?

no, none of them spoke English. and I never mentioned I was a congressman.

have you mainlined(静脉注射) heroin back here in the States?

just once.

any scars(疤痕；创伤) on your arm?

no, I was mainly into cocaine.

what about prositutes here in DC? how often?

I fucked around a bit, okay?

details, please?

do you get off on this or something?

does a doctor enjoy it when he cups(做成杯状；窝起手掌托住) you balls and askd you to cough(咳嗽；发出咳嗽般的声音)?

you wanna know how many times I came?

I honestly don't care whether you win. but if you do, work with me.

how often did you solicit(请求，索求，征求) prositutes in DC??

once every two or three months. sometimes more frequently, sometimes less. 

do you have reason to believe any of them were underage(未成年的)?

Jesus. No, look, there were mostly high-end.

that doesn't mean they were 18.

I need a fucking break.

what's going on?

he's an amateur(非专业的，业余爱好的；不熟练的), Frank. If I can get under his skin in less than an hour. how do you think he'll hold up under the press? it'll be a Turkey shoot.

all right. I'll speak to him.

Frank, it's just... it's not gonna work. I'm gonna get crucified(折磨；十字架上钉死；克制).

you'll be fine. we've got a crack(破裂，裂开；崩溃) team behind you. 

it doesn't matter how good the team is. I mean with my pass? come on.

from the very begining. I said this was the plan. and you agreed to it.

I didn't think it through.

we have to tackle(应付，解决（难题或局面）) this head-on, or the GOP will crucify(折磨；十字架上钉死；克制) you. we have to steal their ammunition(弹药，军火；（批评或辩论中攻击他人的）把柄，证据) from them. honesty is your best defense and offense( 进攻，攻击行为；进攻队员；（球队的）进攻).

I'm the one that has to get in front of these cameras and say this shit. they don't have to say it. I do.

Peter...

I wanna be governor, I do. but not this way, I just can't do it.

if you weren't unsure now, there'd be something wrong with you. I expected this, not easy... what we're asking you to do. it's okay to vacillate(观点（或立场等）摇摆，动摇) a little.

I'm not trying to throw a wrench(猛拉，猛扭，挣脱；扭伤) in the works.

I know you're not, I'll tell you what. you take the rest of the day off. you go back to you office, you catch up with whatever you have to catch up on. you get a good night's sleep, you go to a meeting tomorrow. and then you come here and we'll talk the whole thing through. can you give me at least that?

yeah, ok, Frank.

Good.

what's going on with all the little sculptures(雕塑（sculpture 的复数）；雕像)? I found a flower on the dining room table. and a bird on the nightstand(床头柜) a few days ago.

it's a swan(天鹅).

you made them.

yes.

a new hobby(爱好)？

no, it's an interest.

may I bring up something else I've noticed?

what that?

you standing in front of the refrigerator. is there a reason you haven't talked to me about it?

I haven't felt the need to.

is it bad?

it's not pleasant. but no, it's not bad.

what can I do?

nothing. If there was something, I'd ask.

did you think it was weird(奇怪的，不寻常的) that I called you?

totally weird. except for the fact that I was planning to on calling you.

really? why?

I was a real grade-A bitch to you at the herald, and I almost apologized when I saw you at the white house. but I chickened out(<非正式>因害怕而放弃，胆怯（chicken out）). so, anyway, I am drunk enough, and I am sorry. why did you call me?

I was just wondering how things were going at the old stomping(跺脚，重踩；跳顿足舞) ground.

here you go.

thank you.

It's just not the same since tom left. and I don't blame you for doing what you did. but this new guys? six years running EW online does not a managing editor make.

would you ever wanna come work with us?

I mean, it'd be a huge fucking deal. chief political correspondent of the herald moves to Slugline?

did Carly Heath put you up to this?

no, not at all. but if you want, I can talk to her.

you think she would go for it?

honestly, i don't know. she's got this sort of anti-establishment 'fuch you' attitude. conventional(依照惯例的，遵循习俗的；老一套的) news bores her. but if you had something gritty(坚韧不拔的；有砂砾的；多沙的；像砂的) to show. I've got a story if you want it. it's pretty fucking great.

you would give away a story?

if you not interested.

no, I'm interested.

if I seen a little hung over(宿醉未醒), it is because I am. a lot hung over, actually. god, I almost had a couple of months. and then last night, I... well, I don't remember much, so... but anyway, here I am.

keep coming back, it works if you work it. thank you for sharing, Diane.

I'm Doug, and I'm an alcoholic, one of the things I do for a living is count. I count votes, yeas, nays, neutrals(中性色；中立者), abstaining(弃权，不投票). and I'm good at it. but the most important count I do has nothing to do with work. It's the number of days since April 4th, 1999. as of this morning, that's 5185. the bigger that number get, the more it frightens(使惊吓，使惊恐) me. because I know all it takes is one drink to go back to zero. most people see fear as a weakness. it can be, sometimes for my job, I have to put fear in other people. I know that's not right, but if I'm honest, like the fourth step asks us to be, I have to be ruthless(无情的，冷酷的；（行为等）坚决的，果断的), because failure is not an option. the same goes for my sobriety. I have to be ruthless with myself. I have to use my fear. it makes me strong. like everyone in this room, I can't control who I am. but I can contorl the zero. fuck the zero.

thanks for sharing. it works if you work it. who would like to share next?

was he at the meeting?

he was. I tried to find him afterwards. but he was gone before I could catch up with him.

did he say anything?

no, he never shares. he looked preoccupied(全神贯注的，心事重重的；被先占的).

you think he'll show up at the house today?

I have no idea. he's not answering my calls.

mine neither. anything else I need to know? I hear silence, I don't like that sound.

something came up, I'm handing it.

something serious? 

serious but solvable.

do I wanna know more?

I don't think you do, we'll be ok. I might have to involve Nancy, I'm hoping I won't have to. but if I do, she'll have no knowledge of anything danaging.


all right, use your best judgment.

of course sie.

I've gotta go.

Miss Gallagher?

can the congressman have a moment?

things are... they're complicated(复杂的，难处理的).

I realize that, but he trully needs you.

I don't know that I could say to him.

look, I think just showing up would do him a world of good.

today is tough. the speaker has a full schedule...

look, I've already spoke to Bob, and he said he'd be fine if you took the rest of the day off. In fact, he said he'd be fine if you wanted to take the next six months off.

what?

I want you to be deputy campaign manager. you work under Nash Asrons.

NO, I spent years being Peter's crutch(拐杖；支柱；依靠；胯部). if you just want me there...

well, of course we want you there to help, but not as a crutch. Peter is a talented young man with a lot of potential(潜在的，可能的). he knows this, but he needs to hear it form someone other than me. someone he truly care about.

I'm sorry, this is just a lot right now.

well, you don't have to make a decision now. but at least talk to Peter, I mean, there's no harm in that, now, is there?

ten grand(<非正式>一千美元). we divert it from your campaign accounts. we itemize(逐条列记) it so it looks like...

wait. you want me to pay for this? use Frank's reelection fund.

commissioner, the majority of the money that you've raised has come from people we've sent your way. and you sent them because I sprung(蹦跳；突然弹起；突然启动；惊起) your boy Russo in the first place.

we're even. I don't owe you shit.

there's a girl in trouble. let's help her out.

not my problem.

it could be. we put her back on the streets, there's no telling what she would do.

I'm a hell of a lot more afraid of the US attorney(律师；代理人) than I am of some hooker.

this is a very inexpensive insurance policy.

I already broke the law once, Doug. there's no fucking way I'm gonna mess with campaign finance regulation(规章制度，规则；（运用规则条例的）管理，控制). I don't even wanna be hearing this shit.

Funeral(葬礼) for the former ambassador(大使) of Japan tomorrow at 9:30, followed by a luncheon(正式的午餐，午宴) for the national board of directors for the girl scouts(童子军（the Scouts）) of America. after that, you've got a meet and greet with the finalist

I'll catch up with you a minute.

this way, sir.

hi, what are you doing here?

the congressman wanted me to come over. he wants me to work for your campaign. Deputy Manager. he said you're having some doubts. 

I was just about to tell him that I decided not to run.

ok. um, if you're made up your mind, then I should probably get going.

did he tell you about the whole plan? about coming clean?

yeah, he did.

I have Kevin and Sarah to think about.

everyone has a past.
 
not like mine. you don't know half the things I've done, Christina. my kids read. their friends read. I can't take the chance.

look, if you don't wanna run, then you shouldn't.

I do wanna run, I wouldn't have let it go this far if I didn't want it.

then maybe it's a good thing. confronting(直接面对) you past, even for your kids. they're a lot stronger than you give them credit for. look, if Underwood, if the DNC, if they all think you can do it, then

I don't care what they think, I care about what you think.

I think you'll be great.

so, she really wants this?

that's the impression(印象，感想；影响) I got.

what about ego(自负，自尊，自我意识；（心理学）自我)?(脾气怎么样?) I don't need to be dealing with a diva(名媛；喜怒无常的女人).

she's not a diva, she's an award-wining journalist with 15 years' experience.

you told me she treated you like shit.

there was some friction(不和，分歧；摩擦；摩擦力).

so why are you going to bat for her?

don't we want to work with the best people? plus, it's be big for the site. the herald's senior political write.

sure, but she's so old guard. everything's by the book. there's no bite to it.

she told me about a profile she's working on. it's got serious bite.

what is it?

she can tell you herself, you should talk to her.

here's the deal, my children stay out of the limelight(公众注意的中心；（舞台照明用的）石灰光，石灰光灯). no photo ops, no press.

we wouldn't dream of it.

ok, let't do this.

motel.(汽车旅馆)

where you from?

outside of Lynchburg.

Virginia?

yeah.

are your parents still living there?

no, I can't.

If I find a place for you to stay for a while. can I count(看作，认为) on you to be smart?

what kind of place?

a nice place. a safe place until we can figure out something permanent(永久的，永恒的).

and I need to know that you won't pull anything like this again.

promise me.

I promise.

look at me when you say it.

I promise you.

how you doing on money?(钱还够花吗？)

I don't have enough for tomorrow.

what are you doing?

I thought you wanted me to...

you said you were done with that.

I'll be in touch.

if you own up to some of the shenanigans(恶作剧；诡计), sweep the rest under the rug(小地毯，垫子), you might have a shot.

how much do we have to sweep under?

well, the kid had a talent for covering his tracks. I've highlighted all the items I think he should admit to. the rest I wouldn't mention.

it's a lot not to talk about.

I need your help with something.

right now?

yes.

is it important? because you told me I could leave early this weekend to go visit my daughter down in Virginia.

you have a guest room in your house, right?

well, it's Mary's old room, but, yes.

I need you to put someone up for a wihle. a young woman.

what? who?

her name is Rechel, I can't tell you anymore than that.

I don't understand, why do you need..

no question, Nancy, I just need you to do this for me. I wouldn't be asking if it weren't serious.

put up for how long?

it could be a while.

I'm supposed to put up a complete stanger and not ask any questions?

Nancy, please.

you're the only person I can trust.

is something illegal going on?

no, she's just a girl in trouble who needs a place to stay. we have to be discreet(谨慎的，周到的；小巧的，不引人注意的).

can I at least meet her first?

I need to know now.

ok, I guess.

thank you.

there's no catch, Larry. your district gets over 20 million if the numbers hold. and most of the money is earmarked(指定……的用途；划拨（款项）) for economic development. not reserch. that's great, but I need more than your support. I need you to be a sponsor. Fantastic, Larry. Greate, I'll put you down. you too, bye.

so that just leaves Clayburn... and Price?

with Jennings on the fence(篱笆，栅栏，围栏).

and I know Roger, I'll call him.

and I'll track down these other two over the weedend.

really good work today, Peter. do you know where I put my purse(钱包，皮夹子)?

it's right here.

did you make those? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry(窥探；杠杆).

oh, this, I've been fooling around with a little bit.

can I see? Sarah learned how to make these birds in her art class. then she taught it to Kevin, and they got obsessed(使着迷；使心神不宁；挂牵，念念不忘). and there were little pieces of paper all over the apartment.

do you wanna take them for the kids?

oh, no, I can't.

oh, please, I'll just throw them out eventually(最终，结果).

thank you, they'll love them.

so you should bring the kids by the house. sometime so I can meet them.

Kevin and Frank can play the video games.

he told you that?

I was a little surprised. I have to admit.

if anybody knew he came home every day to... it's embarrassing.

there's worse secrets to have.

yeah, there are, I suppose.

I'll call you Monday after I talk to Clayburn and Price.

ok, great, have a good weekend. Peter.

you too.

I have Linda talk to the vice president. he'll keep his nose out of it.

I appreciate that. he is a good man, but this is very delicate(柔和的，清淡的；虚弱的) moment in the campaign. you start spreading(扩散，蔓延) doubts, and...

he'a a pain in the ass(傻瓜，笨蛋；屁股，臀部；<旧>驴；性感的人), we all know it. you don't have to mince(切碎，绞碎；装腔作势地小步快走；矫揉做作地说) words, Frank.

I have to say, sir, the vice president has a pint. I'm not 100% sold on(热衷于) Russo. do we really wanna go with someone this untested?

Frank?

we're grooming(擦洗，刷洗) him. sir.

when do you announce?

next month.

that's not enough time.

what do you see in him?

I was wondering the same thing. there's not that much to see.

what I see is a recovering alcoholic with a history of drug abuse(辱骂；舞弊，腐败；糟蹋；性侵犯；恶习，陋习).

what?

excuse me, Frank?

but he's clean now, has been for a year. this is a redemption((基督教指耶稣的）救赎，赎罪；（从过失或罪恶中）拯救人的事物；兑换；弥补) story, Mr. president. this is a bright young man who's put his life back on track. now he wants to help put Pennsylvania back on track.

Durgs, Frank?

people love an underdog(比赛中不被看好者；失败者；受压迫者；斗败了的狗；黑马), Linda. and people love someone who stands up after they've fallen. combine those two, it's a very powerful narrative. all of your polling(投票；轮询) indicates(表明（indicate 的第三人称单数形式）；指示，显示) this is gonna work.

you wants us to endores someone with a history of substance(物质，材料；主旨，主要内容；重要性；真实性，可信性；毒品) abuse?

let us get his story out there and watch it connect with the votes.

all I care about is a win, Frank.

and I believe Russo is our best chance. this is not a hail(赞扬，欢呼；呼喊) mary(马利亚), Mr. president. this is a well-thought-out game plan. 

Mr. president

I realize that I sometimes think out of the box, but the last time I did, we signed an education bill.

all right. we won't stand in your way.

but if it backfires(产生事与愿违的不良（或危险）后果，适得其反), Frank...

I'll guide Peter every step along the way. we will not disappoint you, Mr. president.

ok.

thank you, sir. Linda.

I didn't plan on telling him so much so soon, but if I didn't, Linda would've swayed(摇摆，摇晃，摆动；影响（某人）) him.

there's no better way to overpower(压倒；克服；使无法忍受) a trickle(慢速移动；滴，淌，细流) of doubt thank with a flood of naked(使某人裸露) truth. this is why the education bill was so important. it brought me influence precisely(精确地，准确地；恰好，正是（表示强调）；（用于表示完全同意）的确如此；严谨地，细致地) when I need it most.

how long have you been drinking?

a long time. since I was a kid.

how old were you when you had your first drink?

nine.

nine years old.

yeah, my dad gave me a beer for my ninth birthday.

when did you first start using drugs?

I won't go into too many specifics. other than to say I had a few minor(较小的，次要的，轻微的) brushes with marijuana and cocaine in the past but not recently. and only a hardful of times.

no other drugs besides marijuana and cocaine.

no.

and under what circumstances(条件，情况，环境；境况，经济状况)?

occasional social gatherings, that's the most I'll say.

ever while you were in public office?

no, never, my chief problem was alcohol.

and you've been sober how long now?

a little over a year.

and what made you want to get sober?

two things, my children, whom I love more than anything else in the world. and my renewed faith in God.

Zoe.

Lucas.

I was just in the neighborhood, and I thought.. no, that's a lie. I was at the bar around the corner. the one with the, uh... and I remember that time that I dropped you off after work. I knew it was this block. and I, uh, buzzed, and then I waited...

you're wasted.

I'm pretty wasted. do you wanna konw a deep, dark secret? now, we don't work together anymore. 

Lucas. I'm really flattered(奉承，讨好；使高兴，使感到荣幸). but I'm just not in a place where I'm even thinking romantically right now.

I'm sorry, I, uh...

you want me to pull up now, sir?

I still have my key.

I'll be in the kitchen if you need anything.

thank you.

hey, I got us wine, but I can't find a corkscrew(螺旋形开瓶器) anywhere.

give it to me. I need a pan.

the pan the president gave you?

that'll work.

did you talk to MS. Skorsky?

I did, she said it was intense(很大的，十分强烈的；严肃紧张的，激烈的；热情的).

I think Carly's gonna offer her a job at Slugline.

was that your doing.

Jannie expressed interest.

well done, always good to be owed favors. I was wondering, do you ever think about my age?

no, does my age bother you?

you must have other lovers... men that are younger than me.

no, not that I would mind. I am married, after all.

I don't have time for other lovers.

em. shit. it's turned(变质). give me that.

you could've just stepped on it.

I have asked the super to get an exterminator(根除者；（美）灭鼠药；（美）职业的消灭害虫者) in here. and he won't do it, so anytime I see a cockroach(蟑螂) or a spider, or whatever, I try and trap(诱捕，抓捕) it, and then I leave it by his door.

you really ought(应该（表义务、责任、必要等）；应该（表期望）) to get your parents to let you borrow some money. then you wouldn't have to live in the third world. 

I would never take money from them.

because they don't have it, or because you don't want it.

because I don't want it.

it's father's day, you know.

is it?

you should call your father.

I'll call him tomorrow.

tomorrow you'll be the daughter that forgot father's day. instead of the one who recommended. go ahead. call him.

hey, dad, sorry it's to late.

cause you weren't home the last time I called her.

there's so little she'll ever reveal(揭示，透露；表明，证明；展示) to me or I to her. I bet her father knows even less. I'm sure she's speaking half an octave(八度音阶；八行诗) higher. same voice she had when she was 16. telling him all about her new job, how much she misses him. and sorry she didn't send a card. telling him everything but the truth. just like she wouldn't tell me about the young man downstairs.

I'm calling you now right, don't make me feel bad about it. it was the best thing that could've happeded. I didn't fit in there. I've been called worst, dad.

there's a value in having secrets. Creatures like myself, like Claire, like Zoe, we wouldn't be ourselves without them. but Peter Russo on the other hand. he's trapped(设陷阱（或夹子、捕捉器）捕捉；使陷入圈套，使中计；诱捕，抓捕) by his secrets. what I'm trying to do is give him the opportunity to set himself free. after all, we are nothing more or less that we choose to reveal. what I am to Claire is not what I am to Zoe, just like Zoe is not to me what she is to her father.

because I'm not interested in that. I would tell you, dad.

### chapter 8

control stacked, energy-efficient(生效的，效率高的；（人）有能力的，能胜任的).

now, mind you. the whole collection could probably fit on a kindle. but at lease the cadets(学员；士官生；受军训的学生) will have  another place get out of the rain.

did you have any input on the design?

I approved the blueprints(蓝图). if something's gonna have my name on it, I want to make damn(该死，见鬼（表示很生气或失望）；天啊（表示赞叹或惊奇）; 极其，非常；丝毫不) sure they build it right,

I think my husband fancies himself a bit of an architect

well, Jefferson designed Monticello, and he also fucked his slaves.

luckily, I don't have any. so that particular temptation hasn't presented itself.

the Sentinel, south Carolina's premiere(首要的，最早的) military college. they taught me the values of honor, duty, and respect. they also hazed(变朦胧；<美>戏弄（大学新生，作为入学或入会仪式的一部分）；变糊涂；使劳累，使劳役折磨) me, tried to break me. and senior year, nearly expelled(把……开除（或除名）；驱逐；排出) me when I volunteerd(自愿做，义务做，无偿做) for a Senate Race and my studies suffered(遭受，经历; 变差，变糟). but that didn't stop them from soliciting(请求，索求，征求（意见）) a hefty(高大健壮的，笨重的) sum for their new library 30 years later. how quickly poor grades(等级，品级) are forgotten in the shadow of power and wealth.

your drink is only about half as full as it should be, Frank.

are you trying to get me drunk?

drunk, passed out in the gutter(排水沟，街沟), so I can steal your wife. 

did you get the email about the riflemen(步枪兵；火枪手；步枪手)?

what email?

from my office about the invitations. I was hoping they would be here.

I'll check the list, but I don't remember any email.

oh, not a problem, I was just wondering.

well, shit, Frank, I'm sorry.

Don't you sweat(流汗，出汗，冒汗) it for a second. In face, here's how you can make it up to me... freshen(变得新鲜；减少盐分) my drink.

that I can do.

congratulations, congressman.

Remy, nice to see you here.

Gerry and all the folks(人们；家人，双亲) at Sancorp give you their regards.

well, I'm sorry they couldn't make it.

where's Claire?

oh she's here somewhere, fending(避开，挡开；回避) off admires.

Sancorp was very disappointed she turned down their donation.

I can imagine.

and they're also concerned(担心，忧虑) about Peter Russo running for governor.

now, how do you know about that?

three quarters of Pennsylvania sits on top of the Marcellus Shale(页岩；泥板岩). if I can't find out who's running for governor, I don't deserve a dime(十分硬币；<非正式>小钱，少量的钱) of what they're paying me.

this watershed bill Russo sponsors places a lot of restrictions(限制规定，限制法规) on drilling.

Remy, congress is in recess(（议会、委员会等政治机构的）休会), and this weekend is not about work.

I apologize, you are absolutely right.

is Sancorp your only account?

I have plenty, but my other clients didn't pay for your library or my plane(飞机；（几何学中的）平面) ticket down here.

it's a nice little junket(野餐；游览) for you. I do hope you're taking in the sights.

this isn't my first trip to Charleston.

but I'll bet it's your first time not as my press Secretary.

it is. who else do you have coming in?

I didn't want to pack tonight too much. you know, these receptions(招待会；接待处) are usually just for the money people. like youself.

Normally, this is where I would start to drone(嗡嗡叫，嗡嗡响) on about the Sentinel's history, its philosophy(哲学；哲学体系), its yadda, yadda, yadda. but I'm going to save that for my big speech tomorrow, and that way I'm not gonna bore y'all tears twice. tonight we're going to turn it over to a man who needs no Introduction, because we all know what a son of a bitch he is. seriously, though, Frank Underwood exemplifies(是……的典范；举例说明) all the virtues(优点，贞操；美德) we try to instill(徐徐滴入；逐渐灌输) in our graduates. we're so proud to call you an alumnus(男校友；男毕业生), Frank. and to have your names as a permanent(永久的，永恒的) fixture(固定装置，固定家具) on our campus(（大学或学院的）校园；大学生活). congressman, Frank Underwood.

thank you, president Hillken.

I first want to thank Sancorp industries for providing the funds to make the library possible. when I matriculated(准许……入学；录取……入大学) here as a young cadet(幼子，次子；实习生；候补军官；陆海军官学校的学员), Jimmy Carter had just been elected president. after I graduated, I wished that I could have had another four years, just like Jimmy, well, neither of us got our wish. But I left this campus with fond(喜爱的，喜欢做……的) memories. the first time I ever...

oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton(棉，棉花；棉布；棉线), old times there are not forgotten, look away, look away, look away. I got your damn(该死，见鬼) email. I wish I was in Dixie, Hooray, hooray, in Dixieland, I'll take my stand to live and die in Dixie. away, away, away down South in Dixie. From the halls of Montezuma, to the shores of Tripoli, we will fight our country's battles, 

the honey child... when she stepped out in the... trying on the bra on housewives of Atlanta, and I teased(取笑, 戏弄) you about that, and I said... I called it the honey child, because she's the honey child now. anyway, he's the thing...

how long has that light been like that?

I don't know, a month, maybe.

and nobody's come to fix it?

nobody don't fix nothing around here.

well, have you asked?

shh, I'm watching.

leave it done, I'm used to it now.

better, uh.

now it's too dark.

what did you do that for?

listen, ma, I'm running for governor. I'm going to announce it in a few days. that's why I came up to Philly, there's a community meeting tomorrow. I'm going to talk to the shipbuilders about a plan to bring their jobs back, so they'll support me in the election.

I don't know nothing about that stuff, It's over my head.

ok. listen, there's going to be some stroies coming out about me in the news, about my past, I just wanted to give you a heads-up so it doesn't catch you off guard.

I don't watch the news no more, a bunch(群；串；突出物) of garbage.

you want to see some pictures of Kevin and Sarah?

too dark to look at pictures.

no, no, no, it's on my phone, you don't need any...

get it away from me. I hate those things. Brain(脑) cancer(癌症；痼疾).

it wasn't just up the stairs. it was up three flights of stairs, in the science building, and Guckenheimer, what did he did, 'well, you look lovely today, Mrs. Governor' and the thing took a dump(垃圾场；废料堆场). right, and they couldn't get it back... 

you can get a cow up three flights of stairs. but you can't get it down. and that's why Andy said,'who wants steak for dinner?'

how are you boys doing?

we're good. you think I'm fat?

take the fifth. seriously, Phil, here, thinks I got fat with old age.

ah, you're a big man with an even bigger heart.

there you go.

she said you're chubby(圆胖的，丰满的).

Frank, I'm going to go back to the hotel.

ok.

have fun.

I love this woman.

yeah, she...

don't let him get into too much touble.

they'll have grounds for impeachment(弹劾；控告；怀疑；指摘) when we're done with him.

better get another drink before they close up.

you're coming with me to help carry them, you're gonna be a waiter tonight.

lazy-ass cadet. lazy-ass cadet. 

yeah, hold on a second there, partner.

you had no idea we were coming?

complete surprise.

I thought Higgins might have...

no, he played it prefectly. make me think you weren't coming at all.

are you kidding? we wouldn't have missed it for the world. on the library, are they going to put 'Frank' or 'Francis'?

'Francis', it's the same as the name above the door in my office in the Capitol.

'Francis' is better for libraries. 'Frank' is better for bumper(丰收的，丰盛的；巨大的，大号的) stickers(（有图或文字的）粘贴标签，贴纸).

I got a few of those. does anybody ever actually call you Francis?

Claire does, she's the only one.

she seems like a real prize(奖品，奖项；非常珍贵的人（或物），十分重要的人（或物）).

she is.

bar was already shut down, but look what I scored(得分，比分).

hi, Carolina.

what do you want?

is Paul around?

Paul? did you invite this man? answer me, did you invite him?

what are you talking about?

Carolina, stop.

no, you're not going to stop me.

Paul? you got a minute to talk?

there's nothing to talk about.

I want to apologize for when I saw you last time in Washington. how I treated you. 

is that it?(就这样吗？)

and I want to talk about the shipyard. I got a plan to fix it.

you don't want everything going into the Roth IRA, 5, 10 grand a year. I'll set you up with a nice, diversified(（使）多样化，（使）不同) package. low-risk, high-yield(产生（收益、效益等），产生（结果）)

I think Claire and I have things pretty well under control.

If I brought a senior US congressman into the fund, that would really up my stock in the company.

what are you all gabbing about back there?

we're talking about the old library. yeah, what's happening to it? they gonna tear it down?

I don't know, they could gut(取出……的内脏（以便烹饪）；毁坏（建筑物）的内部) it. they could turn it into a student center.

we should sneak(偷偷地走，潜行；偷带，私运) in there. like we used to.
 
I'm game, do it. hey, why not?

that's it. there you go, that's it.

shh, it's a library. this is Sentinel.

the association had about 3 million saved up in reserve(预订；保留，预留) for emergencies(紧急事件；紧急需要). split that up between 12,000 members, it's nothing. a couple of week's groceries.

there's a bill I'm working on. major federal funds going towards public parks, green commercial(商业的，商务的；商业化的) spaces, cleaning up waste sites. that's construction(建造，建筑；创立，构建；构造) jobs, park management, retail...

how many?

5,000 jobs.

that's not even half.

it's a start.

how soon?

A year, maybe two. 

two fucking years?

what are we supposed to do until then?

listen, there's a community meeting tomorrow.

I heard.

I'm gonna go over everything in detail. you gonna be there?

wasn't planning on it.

I'd like you to be there. everybody respect you.

want me to vouch(担保；证明；传出庭作证) for you?

listen, I'm gonna tell you something that only a handful(一把；少数，少量； 难以控制的人) of people know. I'm running for governor. I announce soon. but I need the association behind me before I do that. now, I know I let you down with the shipyard. but if I win a governor's race. I can get everything back on track.

you show up on my doorstep asking for my forgiveness, now you want me to be your lapdog(供玩赏用的小狗；（可携带的）小宠物狗；走狗) after I lost my fucking job?

this watershed bill is just the begining. if I'm governor, there's so much I can do.

it's bullshit, you just want to use me.

it's not like that.

yeah, it's exactly like that.

Jesus Christ, Peter. you fucking politicians.

Paul.

Claire, I didn't relize you and Frank were staying here.

we always stay here when we're in Charleton. you know that, Remy.

the 08 campaign.

I promise it was a coincidence(巧合，同时发生；相符，一致；符合), my assistant booked it. is, uh, Frank around?

he's not, he's off cavorting(腾跃；欢跃；寻欢作乐) with old classmates. you want to sit down and have a drink?

they booked me the birdal(新娘的；婚礼的 | n. 婚礼) suite. there's champagne on ice.

my, my, you've grown very confident since you worked for Francis.

I've always been confident, Claire.

oh, you never would have invited me upstairs.

never had the bridal suite, the staff always stayed in the best western four blocks away.

enjoy your champagne.

I wasn't suggesting anything more than a drink.

weren't you?

purely being polite.

good night, Remy.

the birdal suite's on the top floor, at the end of the hallway. if you change your mind. good night, Claire.

I know a girl upon a hill, I know a girl all dressed in pink. she made me fingers stink(发恶臭，有异味). sound off, make it loud.

here you go, hey, Kenny, I think you got a little too big for this. 

I think the hole got a lot smaller.

don't let a little girth(周长；围长；肚带) stop you.

here it is. look, look, look

oh, oh, you found it, Killer, 

oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you, Far away you rolling river,  around way, cross the wide Missouri.

hey, good, and you? oh, I'm in Charleston, actually.

what are you doing here?

I thought I'd surprise you. surprise.

come on, let me show you where I went through puberty(青春期，发育期；开花期).

I can totally see you here at 16. got in some trobule on this bed, huh? 

woke up the whole block.

hey, how'd it go with Paul?

he told me funk off. which is what my mother told me, in her own special way.

am I going to meet her?

you don't want to meet her.

I just wanted to stop by, say hey, see her face.

Christina, it was really sweet of you to come up here. seriously, I'm offically(正式地；官方地；作为公务员) convinced(使确信，使信服；说服，劝服). you're the most amazing woman I've ever been with, but I meant it when I said I wanted to take this trip alone. this thing tomorrow isn't going to be pleasant.

which is why I came...to be here for you. moral(道德准则（标准）；寓意，道德上的教训) support.

they're going to lay into me big time.

tomorrow'a an important day for the campaign.

don't flight me on this.

ok.

so do I get a hotel? do I stay here?

come on. don't be like that.

a hotel would be more comfortable.

but it would be a water of valuable campaign funds.

ok, compaign funds.

you see that crack(裂缝，裂纹；缝隙) up in the ceiling(天花板，吊顶；上限，最高限度；最高飞行限度，升限)?

I used to fall asleep starting at it every night.

it's dark in here, I'm scared(使惊恐，吓唬；受惊吓，害怕 ).

be fucking careful, man.

let there be light.

what are you thinking about?

how come you and Frank have never had kids?

you've never had kids.

yeah, but I'm not married. answer the question.

we just decided not to. there wasn't some big conversation.

I think you're lying.

think whatever you want.

you've honestly never thought about it?

I mean, yeah, maybe, once or twice. I mean, I don't feel there's some void(空间，空白，空虚). I'm prefectly happy without.

what about you?

Can you Imageine me wiping(擦干净，抹掉) a baby's ass and changing nappies(尿布；含酒精饮料（尤指啤酒）?

no, I can't, actually, yes, I just did. I'm gonna have to get off the phone. you've ruined everything. well, we really should get off. it's been over an hour, I think.

ok, go on then.

I'm hanging up right now.

no, I am.

come on, don't quit on me.

oh, I lost count.

don't be... don't quit.

oh, God. oh, you win, but it's not a fair fight. you run a rafting(乘坐筏子（度河），用筏子运送) company. I sit behind a desk all day.

oh, I'd love to see your ass with a paddle(短桨，桨). bouncing through a class-four rapid(急流，湍滩；高速交通工具，高速交通网).

if I can whip congress into submission(屈服，投降；提交，呈递). I'm not afraid of a little white water.

you can't tame(驯化，驯服；制服，控制) a rapid, Frank.

my heart is beating so fast... If I have a heart attack, it's your fault

mine too. here.

I need another drink.

I think I'll have another too.

don't bogart(博加特（姓氏）；弓的力量（星座名的含义）) that. (别一人独享)

do you think this place made us?

how do you mean?

when I walked on campus today. I wondered, did it mean anything? if it's just a place we spent four years of our lives or was there more? 

I don't know, I do know you were always the guy that was gonna get a building named after him. I knew that the moment I saw you cuss(乱骂；咒骂) out the drill(钻，钻机) sergeant(陆军、海军陆战队或空军的）中士；（英国的）巡佐，（美国的）警佐) when we were knobs(球形把手；旋钮；<英>小块（黄油等）；球形突出物；<英，非正式>阴茎；<美>圆形小山).

the library is a sham(假的东西，假象). Higgins asked me a favor. I asded someone else a favor. they slapped(打，拍；拍打，拍击) my name on it. politics, like everything else.

not everybody gets asked those favors. or knows how to deliver on them.

oh, in 50 years they'll just replace it with something else. just like they're doing with this for mine.

you still built something, however long it lasts.

the library doesn't matter, but I want to think this place did.

I think it mean a lot to us, then.

and what about us?

honestly, I haven't really thought about it that much. it's a long time ago.

we were so close.

like brother.

more than brother.

we were kids, Frank. we messed(弄脏，弄乱；玩弄) around a couple of times.

I was so drawn(画，绘制；拖，拉) to you.

I could always make you laugh.

how did we lose touch?

you went to law school, I joined the army. you ran for congress, I moved to Colorado. 30 years goes by, I got children older than we were back then, do you have anyone, Frank?

I have Claire.

besides Charlie.

I have, from time to time. If I want someone, I want them, it's attraction(有吸引力的事物；吸引力；（两性间的）吸引；（物体间的）引力；（错误的）形态同化).

made me happy to make you happy, Frank. didn't see any harm in it. you know why I love rafting? when you're on the water, all you're thinking about is what's right in front of you. everything is in a moment, I don't really have time to think about the past.

you meant something to me. I believe that. all gone. I don't feel so well.

you gonna be sick?

no, no, I just take a break(稍停，休息), can we just take a ... for a litte bit, until I feel beter.

take as long as you like. I got nowhere to go.

it almost 7:00,

I don't even wanna sleep.

come on.

1,100 acres are developed.

yes.

30% public parks.

yep,

45% shopping offices.

yes.

25% middle- income housing.

you going?

is it required?

I don't think so.

who is he that they're naming the place after?

some guy who went here. I think he's dead. we had to set up the chairs yeaterday. it was hot as shit. that sucks.

I'm gonna try to get some shut-eye(打盹) before the ceremony(仪式，典礼；礼节，礼仪，客套). I'll see you all later?

late it is. Frank, before I forget, here's my card. so your money manager can all me. get some rest.

Claire.

you look like you're hurting.

it was an all-nighter.(通宵)

was it fun at least?

it was fun. I need to get some shut-eye.

Remy's staying here.

he harassing(骚扰；不断攻击（敌人）) you about the donations?

oh, nothing I can't handle. go get some rest.

were you god?

not bad. I mean I wasn't a starter(首发), but I got my time on the court.

I think you look sexier now all grown up.

congressman, we're ready for you.

DO NOT DISTURB(请勿打扰)

you said two years. 

I think two years is a realistic(务实的，实事求是的；实际的，现实可行的；写实的，逼真的；实在论的) estimate.

if it passes at all.

which I think it will.

you think, or you know.

I can't predict(预言，预计，预卜) 100%, but I'm confident it will.

you think, you're confident. you can't predict 100%. how does any of that help us? I'll tell you something. I am 100% unable to pay my mortgage(按揭，抵押贷款；抵押贷款额) right now. I am 100% unable to buy my kids school supplies. we supposed to live off my husband's disability(残疾，缺陷；无能力，障碍；残疾补贴)?

there'll be paid training programs available.

how much will they pay?

uh, granted(授予，给予；承认), it's less than you made at the shipyard.

so how much?

it's about 6 an hour.

that's not even minimun wage.

you have to see it as an investment. the training programs are a valuable resource.

you're not getting it. I can't afford to make investment. six dollars an hour puts my family on the street. what do you want me to work? five jobs? 

if you get a part-time job, that and the training programs...

do you wanna know what I think? I think you sit around in Washington coming up with all sorts of fancy numbers and solutions that look good on paper. but that doesn't cut it for the rest of us.

you said you hard our backs, you lying piece of shit. we don't eat paper for dinner. you can't put a paper roof(屋顶，车顶) over your head. when we all voted for you, I don't think that every one of those votes was another nail(（用钉子）钉住，钉牢；抓住) in our own coffin(棺材).

everybody just sit down for ten minutes, we can go over this proposal point by point. and you can get the information that you need to get the resources that you want.

it's like they don't want to find a solution.

they're scared(使惊恐，吓唬；害怕，恐惧).

I understand that they're scared. but that doesn't mean they can't listen.

you don't know these people, Christina.

I worked in your office for three years. I spoke to them, I took their calls. I replied to their emails.

you didn't grow up with them.

I don't need to grow up hand to mouth to empathize(有同感，起共鸣) with the fact that 

they're not interested in empathy.

the house keys are in my jacket. I'll call you.

Peter.

I said I'll call you.

do your homework, it's sister Mary Joseph. you didn't do it. don't lie to me. I used to use the same ploy(策略；活动；工作) with my parents. nah, baloney(胡扯；熏肠；蠢货). we do the homework and then we eat. all right, who's hungry? what do you guys want? 

Hamburgers.

no, pizza. you guys can eat that every...

sweetheart, take the kids upstairs. how'd you get in here?

you still keep the spare key behind the loose(未固定牢的，松动的；零散的，松脱的) brick on the porch(门廊；<美>走廊，游廊).

you break into my house? you scare my kids like that?

we gotta talk, Paul.

we talked last night. now get out.

I can convince(使确信，使信服；说服，劝服) these people, but I need your help.

leave my house.

sit down.

I don't wanna have to hurt you with my children upstairs, Petey.

then help me.

this is your last chance.

I'm not going anywhere.

get back upstairs.

what are we doing? I don't wanna fight you, Petey.

I don't wanna fight you either. I will, but we don't have to.

what do you want me to do?

you elected me to represent you, but I couldn't forestall(先发制人，预先阻止) the inevitable(必然发生的，不可避免的；总会发生的，惯常的). the shipyard was closing. if not this year, then next. or the year after. we all know that. I could have lied to you, I could have pretended to do more, but I don't believe about living in the past, I only care about the future. here's another truth that's gonna be hard to swallow(吞下，咽下), I'm all you've got. nobody in Washington gives a fuck about you. no one.

he's right. whatever you think of Petey, we either go with him or we got nothing.

now, does what I'm offering you come anywhere near what you want or deserve? no, but you gotta open your eyes and take what's in front of you. we can build on that. 5,000 jobs becomes 10,000. then 15,000. not in the snap(喀嚓声，啪嗒声) of a finger, but faster than doing nothing will(意志，决心，毅力；意愿，心愿；遗嘱；意旨，命令). can I count on all of you? all right, I'll take that as a yes.

we'll need your contact information so we can send you materials to share with your friends.

now, let's talk about the way the money's gonna get phased(分阶段进行；（物理）使相位同步，使定相) in. it's gonna happen in six stages. stage one...

oh say does that star-spangled banner yet wave for the land of the free and the home of the brave 

left face, forward march(齐步走，行军).(向左转，齐步走)

Fracis Underwood's career, Harvard law degree. one of the youngest state legislators in the history of South Carolina. a 22-year veteran of the US. congress. house majority whip. speaks volumers about the values young people learn here at the Sentinel. values like honor, duty, discipline(纪律，风纪；惩罚), like sacrifice(牺牲，献出；献祭，供奉), service, and respect. Ladies and Gentlemen, the Francis J Underwood library. congressman?

thank you, I wrote a speech, but I'm not gonna read it. nothing is permanent, not even this building. I don't mean to sound ungrateful(忘恩负义的；不领情的；讨厌的；徒劳的). I'm very grateful, I'm deeply honored. I'm very moved. I had the good fortune(时运，命运；好运，机遇；财富，巨款；未来，前途) of spending most of this weekend with a group of friends. Friends I haven't seen in a very long time. Friends I made here. most of you young cadets(学员；士官生；受军训的学生) probably, uh, don't know who I am. A politician, a name, a few accomplishments. but I don't blame you, when I was your age, why, I didn't care much for what men in gray hair did or what they had to say. I wish I could describe... harmony(和声，和弦；融洽，和睦；和谐，协调), that's the word that stuck in my mind. harmony, it's not about what's lasting or permanent, it's about individual(单独的，个别的；个人的) voices coming together. for a monent, and that monent lasts the length of a breath. that's what I think about my time here. you have to forgive(原谅，宽恕；免除，取消（债务）) me I had more than a few whiskeys last night. you know when I was a cadet, we could drink all night, and then get up in the morning and march 20 miles. but these days I'm lucky I got up these three steps. I wanna thank you very much. this is a great honor. I wanna thank president Higgins. and of course the love of my wife, Claire. thank you all very much.

you okay?

yes.

hi, mum. this is Christina, I told you about her yesterday.

hi, Mrs. Russo.

hey.

we just came by to say goodbye. we have to catch a train in about an hour.

okay.

they still haven't fixed that light?

uh-uh.

things went well today, I think the folks(人们；家人，双亲) in the yard are gonna get behind me.

Peter did a great job.

hand me that blanket(毯子，毛毯；厚层，覆盖层). the AC in here is nuts. what happened to your hand?

I got in a fight.

did you win?

yes, I guess I did. that's my Peter, so you're fucking my son. lighten(减轻；发亮) up, I'm just messing with you.

excuse me.

yeah, hold on a second, yeah?

yeah, my mother's in room 409. she has a light out that needs to be replaced.

all right, I'll take care of it.

okay, thanks.

look, babe, if you put that pink thing on, I'm telling you...

hold on, what is it?

the light in my mother's room.

I told you I'll take care of it later.

no, you'll take care of it now.

I gotta go.

and turn the AC down while you're in there too.

yes sir.

thank you very much.

you're very welcome, sir.

you take care of youself.

I'm real proud of you, Frank. I hate to admit it, but I feel the same.

well, having all you here was what made it special. now you stay in touch.

will do, see ya, buddy.

beautiful ceremony, Frank.

yeah, they did a good job.

your speech, I'm glad I was here for that. 

me too.

you should come out to Salida sometime. I'll take you out on the Arkansas river.

I should do that.

any time you want.

yep.

all right.

Francis?

Edward has the car ready.

I'll be right here.

take you time.

you hear from Peter? 

look like the shipbuilders are on board.

tomorrow morning we start working on his draft for his announcement speech.

got it.

and I want the brief on the mock-up for the watershed bill.

I got that with me.

ride me to the airport. we'll go through it in the car.
