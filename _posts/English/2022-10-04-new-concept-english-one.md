Lesson 129

安：瞧，加里!那个警察正朝你挥手呢。他要你停下来。
Look, Gary! That policeman's waving to you. He wants you to stop.

警察：你认为你现在是在哪儿?在赛车道上吗?你刚才一定是以每小时70英里的速度开车。
**Where do you think you are?** On a race track? **You must have been driving at seventy miles an hour.**

加里：我不会开得那么快的。
**I can't have been.**

警察：我是以每小时80英里的速度赶上你的。难道你没看见限速牌吗?
**I was doing eighty when I overtook you.** Didn't you see the **speed limit?**

加里：恐怕我没有看见，警官。我一定思想开小差了。
I'm afraid I didn't, officer. **I must have been dreaming.**

安：警官，他思想没有开小差。我刚才正告诉他开慢点。
He wasn't dreaming, officer. I was telling him to drive slowly.

安里：所以我才没看见那牌子。
That's why I didn't see the sign.

警察：让我看一看你的驾驶执照。这次我就不罚你款了。但你最好不要再开得这样快。
Let me see your driving licence. **I won't charge you this time.** But you'd better not do it again.

加里：谢谢您。我以后一定会多加注意。
Thank you. **I'll certainly be more careful.**

安：加里，我刚才叫你开慢点吧。
I told you to drive slowly, Gary.

加里：你总是叫我开慢点，亲爱的。
You always tell me to drive slowly, darling.

安：好啦，下次你最好还是听从我的劝告!
Well, next time you'd better take my advice

Lesson 131

马丁：加里，今年你们打算去哪里度假?
Where are you going to spend your holidays this year, Gary?

加里：我们可能到国外去，但我不敢肯定。我妻子想到埃及去，我也想去那儿。我们还拿不定主意。
We may go abroad, I'm not sure. My wife wants to go to Egypt, **I'd like to go there, too.** **We can't make up our minds.**

马丁：你们乘船去，还是乘飞机去?
**Will you travel by sea or by air?**

加里：我们可能乘船去。
We may travel by sea.

马丁：这更便宜些，是吗?
It's cheaper, isn't it?

加里：可能是便宜些，但花的时间长。
It may be cheaper, **but it takes a long time.**

马丁：我肯定你们一定会玩得很痛快。
I'm sure you'll enjoy yourselves.

加里：别那么肯定。我们可能哪里也去不成。我妻子总是担心那的。谁来照看狗啦，谁来看管房子啦，谁来照料花园啦，我们每年都碰到这类问题。算了，我们呆在家里来照看一切。
**Don't be so sure. We might not go anywhere.** My wife always worries too much. Who's going to look after the dog? Who's going to look after the house? Who's going to look after the garden? **We have this problem every year. In the end, we stay at home and look after everything.**

Lesson 141

上周，我4岁的女儿萨莉被邀请去参加一个儿童聚会。我决定带她乘火车去。萨莉非常激动，因为她从未乘过火车。她靠车窗坐着，对她所看到的一切都要问个明白。突然，一个中年妇女上了火车，坐在萨莉的对面。“你好，小姑娘，”她说。萨莉没回答，却好奇地看着她。那位妇女穿着一件蓝色的大衣，戴着一顶大而滑稽的帽子。火车开出车站后，那位妇女打开了手提包，拿出了粉盒。然后她开始打扮起来。“你为什么要那样做呢?”萨莉问。“为了把自己打扮漂亮啊，”那位妇女答道。她放好了粉盒，慈祥地微笑着。“可是你仍然难看呀，”萨莉说。萨莉感到很有趣，而我却很尴尬。

Last week, my four-year-old daughter, Sally, was invited to a children's party. I decided to take her by train. Sally was very excited. Because she had nerver travelled on a train before. She sat near the window and asked questions about everything she saw. Suddenly, a middle-aged lady got on the train and sat opposite Sally. 'Hello, little girl' she said. Sally did not answer, but she looked at her curiously. The lady was dressed in a blue coat and a large, funny hat. After the train had left the station, the lady opened her handbag and took out her powder compact. She then began to make up her face. 'Why are you doing that?' Sally asked. 'To make myself beautiful.' the lady answered. She put away her conpact and smailed kindly. 'But you are still ugly' Sally said. Sally was amused, but I was very embarrassed.

Lesson 143

我住在一个由美丽的树林环绕的古老的小镇上。这是一个著名的风景胜地。每逢星期天，有许许多人从城里来观赏我们的小镇，并在树林中散步。游客已被告知要保持树林的整洁。树下都已设置了废物筐，但是人们仍到处扔垃圾。上星期三我到树林里去散步。我所见到的一切使我非常难过。我数了一下，有7辆旧汽车和3个旧冰箱。废物筐是空的，而满地都是纸片、烟头、旧轮胎，空瓶子和生锈的空罐头盒。在垃圾堆中我发现了一块牌子，上面写着：“凡在此树林里丢弃垃圾者，将依法处置"。

I live in a very old town which is surrounded by beautiful wood. It is a famous beauty spot. On Sundays, hundreds of people come from the city to see our town and to walk through the woods. Visitors have been asked to keep the woods clean and tidy. Litter baskets have been placed under the trees, but people still throw their rubbish everywhere. Last Wednesday, I went for a walk in the woods. What I saw made me very sad. I counted seven old cars and three old refrigerators. The litter baskets were empty and the ground was covered with pieces of paper, cigarette ends, old tyres, empty bottles and rusty tins. Among the rubbish, I found a sign which said, 'Anyone who leaves litter in these woods will be prosecuted'
