# HOUSE OF CARDS
Adonai
26 de diciembre de 2018

## season 1 

### Chapter 1

Hey, what are you doing?

Jesus. Did you get a good look?

Blue Toyota Camry, that’s all I saw.

It’s the Warton`s dog. Oh, man.

It’s not gonna make it.(他撑不过去的。) 

Go see if they’re home.

It’s okay.

There are two kinds of pain.

The sort of pain that makes you strong or useless pain, the sort of pain that’s only suffering.

Moments like this require someone who will act or do the unpleasant thing, or the necessary thing.

There. No more pain.

It was a hit and run.(这是一起肇事逃逸) 

I’m awfully sorry.

He must’ve jumped over the fence again.

Look, Steve is gonna file a report on the car.

He’ ll put his people on it.

We’ ll track them down.

You're stunning.

Shall we?

…three, two, one.

Happy New Year!

Oh. President-elect Garrett Walker.

Do I like him?

No.

Do I believe in him?

That’s beside the point.(那不是重点)

Any politician that gets 70 million votes has tapped into something larger than himself, larger than even me, as much as I hate to admit(承认；招认，招供；) it.

Look at that winning smile, those trusting eyes.

I clung(抓紧；粘住；) to him early on and made myself vital(必不可少的；对…极重要的).

After 22 years in Congress, I can smell which way the wind is blowing(刮，吹).

Jim Matthews, his Right Honorable(光荣的；可敬的；高贵的) Vice President. Former governor of Pennsylvania.

He did his duty in delivering the Keystone State, bless(求上帝保佑，祈神赐福，祝福) his heart.

Now they’re about to put him out to pasture(牧场，牧草地；生活状况，个人发展的机遇).

But he looks happy enough, doesn’t he?

For some, it’s simply the size of the chair.

Linda Vasquez, Walker’ s chief of staff.

I got her hired.

She’s a woman, check.

And a Latina, check.

But more important than that, she’s as tough(坚韧的，坚固的；) as a two-dollar steak. Check, check, check.

When it comes to the White House, you not only need the keys in your back-pocket(后兜), you need the gatekeeper.

As for me, I’m just the lowly House Majority Whip(鞭子).

I keep things moving in a Congress choked by pettiness(琐碎；卑鄙；小气；微小) and lassitude(倦怠；疲乏).

My job is to clear the pipes and keep the sludge(烂泥；淤泥) moving.

But I won’t have to be a plumber(水管工人，水电工) much longer.

I’ve done my time.

I’ve backed the right man.

Give and take. 

Welcome to Washington.

You need a haircut.

You think?

A little trim.

What are you gonna wear?

You mean for the meeting?

For the announcement.

I’ll wear my navy blue, the one with the pinstripes(细条纹).

Good.

You look handsome in that suit.

I don’t know if they’ll announce before your board meeting(董事会).

Well, As long as I can say the donation(捐赠物；捐赠) is coming.

Soon as it’s official, SanCorp will write you the check.

This is going to be a big year for us.

They’re gonna want to start with something big.

That’s why I’m here Really?

What?

I’d say immigration, banking or education.

But none of my regular sources can confirm that.

Because they don’t know, or because they’re not talking?

Because they don’t know.

Keep at it.

Get me something.

Sorry. Sorry, Mr. Hammerschmidt.

Zoe.

Barnes.

Right.

Did it take him a year to remember your name?

Longer.

Good morning, Lucas.

What can I do for you, Zoe?

I am sick(厌倦的，厌烦的) of the Fairfax County Council(政务委员会，地方议会).

You tell me every day.

Move me online.

My own blog.

First person.

Subjective(主观的).

500 words.

Not gonna happen.(不可能发生的)

I’ll go underground.(地下的；地面以下的)

Back rooms, the urinals.(尿壶；小便处)

I’ll win over staff members on the Hill.

They need a place to vent(发泄，表达).

A gossip(流言蜚语，小道消息) column.

No.

We lift(挖出，拔起) the veil(面纱，面罩).

What’s really going on.

This is The Washington Herald(预兆；使者，先驱), Zoe, it’s not TMZ.

Do you know how many people watch TMZ?

I couldn’t care less.

Which is why print journalism(新闻业，新闻工作) is dying(死亡；消失).

Then it’ll die with dignity(尊严，自尊).

At least at this paper.

You’re stuck(卡住的，动不了的) in the 20th century, Lucas.

You lack imagination.

Maybe so, but right now, I don’t need imagination, I need copy.

Your nights and weekends are yours.

I applaud(鼓掌；称赞) whatever you want to do, as long as it’s not on my time.(只要不占用我的时间就行)

You’re telling me to get back to work.

I am.

What you’re really telling me is to fuck off(犯错误（离开）；滚蛋).

I’m telling you both.

It’s Mr. Chapman, already,from Province Trust(委托；信托；信托财产).

Hold my calls, Christina.

Henry.

It’s good to see you.

How long are you in town for?(你要在城里待多久?)

Just today.

You gotta(have got to) come back down for the inauguration(就职典礼；开幕式；开创).

I can hook you up.(我可以帮你牵线。)

How about you hook me up with the zoning laws you promised to get changed?

We’ve got 12 million sitting in escrow(暂由第三者保存的契据；) for an empty lot(小块土地) we can’t build on.

I know. But you gotta understand, it’s a local municipal(城市的，市政的) issue.

I can’t just pick up the phone…

You can’t?

Because that’s not what you led us to believe when you begged for 50 grand(<非正式>一千美元，一千英镑) in donations(捐赠物，捐赠).

Right. One sec.

Christina, I said no calls.

Not while I’m meeting with Mr. Chapman.

The President-elect?

Do you mind?

No, go ahead, please.

Put him through, Christina.

Mr. President-elect.

Thank you.

Yes, we were… We were pleased to win by double digits(数字；手指，脚趾).

Absolutely, anything you need.

I need you to put your long, wet, talented(有天资的，有才能的) tongue between my thighs(大腿) and make me squeal(尖叫声) like Monica…

Me too, me too.

Okay.

Thank you, sir.

I’m so sorry.

Where were we?

Walker, what’s he like?

Is the President-elect running late?

No.

He couldn’t make it.(他来不了。)

I’ll brief him(我会向他报告), though.

Okay.

This is the memo(备忘录) I drafted on our Middle East policy we’ve been developing.

Now, I wanna borrow from Reagan, I’d like to coin(创造新词，首次使用) the phrase “trickle(（使）滴，淌)-down diplomacy(外交，外交技巧).” That way…

Frank, I’m going to stop you there.

We’re not nominating(提名……为候选人) you for Secretary of State.

I know he made you a promise, but circumstances(条件，情况，环境) have changed.

The nature of promises, Linda, is that they remain immune(免疫的；不受影响的) to changing circumstances.

Garrett has thought long and hard about this, and he’s decided we need you to stay in Congress.

When was this decision made?

And why wasn’t I part of a conversation?

I’m sorry, Frank.

If it had been up to me(如果一切都取决于我), I wouldn’t have waited this long to tell you.

So you knew you were going to do this.

It has been an evolving(进化，演化；逐步发展，逐渐演变) discussion.

It’s a chicken-shit move.(这是懦夫的举动。)

Frank… I was vetted.(仔细检查；彻底审查（某人)

Was that a ruse?(策略，计策；诡计)

No.

Let’s be absolutely clear.

You wouldn’t have won without me.

You’re right.

But now we have to lead, and that means making tough choices(艰难的选择).

As you know, education is a top priority(优先事项，最重要的事) for us.

A complete federal overhaul(彻底检修，全面改造；全面改革).

But it’s not just education, Frank.

Congress is split.

We need you there more than we need you in the State Department.

I got you hired, Linda.

I know.

Donations(捐赠物，捐赠), endorsements(背书，票据签字).

I wrote the campaign’s entire foreign policy platform.

I bring years of foreign affairs(公共事务，政治事务) committee…(委员会)

Frank, please.

I wanna speak to Walker personally.

The decision is made.

We need you, Frank.

Will you stand beside us or not?

Of course.

If that’s what the President wants.

I’m very glad to hear that.

I’m curious(好奇的，求知欲强的).

If not me, then who?

Michael Kern.

Well, that is an excellent(极好的，卓越的) choice.

Can we make it more clear?

I just want to make sure it doesn’t look like we’re neglecting(疏于照顾，未予看管) our domestic…(国内的，本国的)

No. No, no, no.

I’m gonna say that we’re expanding our mission(使命，重要任务).

Okay. And we’re bringing on a new organization to help us.

Do you know which one yet?

I’m still looking into a few options, but…

Tell me, what did we agree on, that we could hire how many new people?

Six? Six, maybe seven.

We’ll have enough.

It’s exciting.

This, new direction we’re heading.

I just don’t know where we’re going to fit all the people.

Do you think we have to look into additional space?

No, no, no, no.

I’ll find a way.

Okay, so make the changes to the PowerPoint and let’s meet again at 2:30.

Okay.

It’s me.

I feel like an idiot(白痴，笨蛋) leaving messages like this.

Call me back.

What is it, Zoe?(什么事)

Um… I know you’re going to have your hands full at the White House, so if you need someone to do research or punch out background…

I think I’ll be fine.

Well, if things get hectic(繁忙的，忙乱的), and you need any help.

So you can blog about rubbing(擦，磨擦) shoulders(肩膀) with the big boys?(跟大人物打过交道)

What did Lucas tell you?

Look, no offense(冒犯，伤害), Zoe, but I don’t have time to be anyone’s training wheels(车轮).

I just thought…

No, I was actually offering(提供，给予) to lend(借给，借出) a hand.

That’s it.

Got it.

Thanks.

Claire…

You didn’t call.

I was…

You didn’t call me, Francis.

Nine hours.

You don’t not call me.

Not when it’s this big.

You’re right.

When have we ever avoided each other?

I wanted a solution first.

Do you have one? Not yet.

This affects(影响) me too, Francis.

And it’s not the money I’m upset(使心烦意乱，使生气) about.

It’s that we do things together.

When you don’t involve(牵涉，涉及；包含，需要) me, we’re in free fall(自由落体 自由下坠 自由下降).

I should have called you and I didn’t.

What happened?

She says they need to keep me in Congress.

Linda said that?

Walker wasn’t even there.

That’s what really gets me.(实在令人讨厌/生气)

He didn’t have the courage to look me in the eye…

I knew you shouldn’t trust that woman.

I didn’t.

I don’t.

I don’t trust anyone.

Then how could you not see this coming?

I never thought they were capable(有能力的, 能干).

You don’t usually underestimate(低估，对……估计不足) people, Francis.

I know.

Hubris.(傲慢；狂妄自大)

Ambition.(雄心，野心)

You should be angry.

I’m livid.(铅色的；青灰色的；非常生气的)

Then where is that?

I don’t see it.

What do you want me to do?

Scream(尖叫) and yell(叫喊)?

Throw a tantrum(发脾气；发怒)?

I want more than I’m seeing. You’re better than this, Francis.

Well, I’m sorry, Claire.

I am sorry.

No.

That I won’t accept.

What?

Apologies(n. 道歉；道歉语).

My husband doesn’t apologize(v. 道歉，谢罪), even to me.

How long have you been up?

Hours.

I know what I have to do.

Good.

We’ll have a lot of nights like this, making plans, very little sleep.

I expected that. That doesn’t worry me.

I better get to work.

I laid(放；铺设；安排（lay 的过去分词）) a suit out for you upstairs.

The navy blue one. I love that woman.

I love her more than sharks love blood.

Why do you think they went with him?

We’re too good. They can’t afford(买得起；有（时间）做某事；承担得起) to lose us in Congress.

He’s had work done.(他做过(美容)手术。)

A chin(下巴) tuck(（脸部或腹部的）整容小手术) probably.

He definitely(清晰的，明晰的) dyes(给……染色) his hair.

Do we say anything?(我们需要说什么吗)

No.

God no.(千万别)

Not unless(除非) he brings it up.

Nancy?

9:25…

Cancel everything.

Stamper, you’re with me.

Now, look…

They’ve done us a great favor(帮助；提拔), Doug.

We are no longer bound by(被…限制) allegiances(忠诚，效忠，拥戴).

We serve no one.

We live by one rule and one rule only, never again will we allow ourselves to be put in such a position.

Walker and Vasquez.

All of them.

I hold them all accountable(负有责任的，应作解释的).

Retribution(报应；惩罚；报答；报偿；报复)?

No. No.

It’s more than that.

Take a step back.

Look at the bigger picture.

I think I see what you’re getting at.

Kern first?

That’s how you devour(狼吞虎咽地吃) a whale(鲸), Doug.

One bite at a time.(一口一口来)

Who would you want?

For Secretary of State?

Give me a list of choices.

And however(然而，可是，不过；无论如何) we do this(不管我们打算怎么做), we’ll also need a buffer(起缓冲作用的人（物）).

You mean an errand(差事，跑腿) boy(跟班小弟 使童)?

Yes.

Somebody we control completely.

I’ll keep my ear(耳朵) to the ground(我会留意的).

Good.

I haven’t eaten since yesterday.

I almost pity(同情，怜悯) him.

He didn’t choose to be put on my platter(大浅盘；唱片；唱机转盘).

When I carve(雕，刻；切下，割下) him up and toss(扔，抛，掷；向后甩) him to the dogs, only then will he confront(面对，面临；正视，处理) that brutal(野蛮的，凶残的), inescapable(不可避免的；逃脱不了的) truth.

“My God, all I ever amounted to(等于，意味着) was chitlins(猪肠).”

“And he that shall humble(使谦卑，使感到自惭) himself shall be exalted(颂扬，吹捧).”

Matthew(马太福音) 23, 12.

Thanks be to God.(感谢上帝)

I’d like to speak today on the subject of humility(谦逊，谦恭).

Well, A lot of you have just won re-election(改选，重选；再次竞选).

If you hadn’t, you might not be sitting here.

And of course, we should enjoy our success, and be grateful(感谢的，感激的；) for it.

But never let your gratitude(感激之情，感谢) sour(酸的，酸味的；（牛奶等）馊（味）的，酸臭的) into pride(自豪（感）；自尊（心）；傲慢，自负).

You’ll have many challenges ahead over the next couple(两个，几个；一对夫妇，一对情侣) of years.

And a person’s character isn’t determined by how he or she enjoys victory(胜利，成功，获胜), but rather(相当，在某种程度上) how he or she endures(忍耐；忍受) defeat(失败，战败；战胜，击败).

Nothing can help us endure dark times better than our faith(信任，信心，信念).

Claire.

Hello, Felicity.

How are you?

Good.

How are you?

Good.

I’m sorry about that.

It’s just not right.

Charles and I can’t understand what Walker was thinking.

That’s very sweet of you, but really, between you and me(我只跟你说), I think Francis is relieved(放心的，宽慰的).

He just feels much more at home in Congress.

I would’ve bet a million dollars they were going to pick you.

Well, it’s a good thing you have a million dollars to spare(抽出，拿出).

But you are by far and away the only choice.

I appreciate(欣赏，鉴赏；理解，明白；感谢，感激) you saying that.

I mean, Michael?

Come on.

He’s got half the experience you do…

Garrett is a smart man.

He knows what he’s doing.

You’re a bigger man than I, Frank.

You want some of that wine?

Yes, definitely.(肯定地，当然；明确地)

Man, this is some good shit.

Where did you get it?

I kind of lifted it from the VIP room of the Speakers’(下议院议长) holiday party.

I’m impressed.(钦佩的，印象深刻的)

Bordeaux(波多尔), 20 years old.

It seemed about right for you.

Ouch.

Why would you say that to me?

I’m almost 30.

That’s practically ancient(古代的，远古的) in your book.

I don’t discriminate(区分，辨别；歧视，区别对待) when it comes to age.

Really?

When’s the last time you hired a 40-year-old staffer?

Doesn’t mean I wouldn’t.

As long as she’s good in the sack(床).

Come on.

Well, it’s true, isn’t it?

Where’s this coming from?

You’re not gonna just toss(扔，抛，掷；向后甩) me aside for some slut(荡妇；懒妇；母狗) straight out of Vassar?

So we’re having that conversation.

It’s been six months.

It’s not a little office fling(短暂的风流韵事；一阵尽情的欢乐) anymore.

You want me to say those three magic words.

One of which starts with an L.

Okay, I’ll say ’em.

Christina Gallagher, lick(舔，舔吃) my balls. Oh, my… You’re a bastard(私生子；卑鄙小人，讨厌鬼).

I love you.

I love you, Christina.

I love you.

Now will you lick my balls?

So I’m curious(好奇的，求知欲强的).

Are we patrons(赞助人；老顾客（patron 的复数）；庇护人), benefactors(捐助人，赞助人) or lepers(麻疯病患者；受蔑视的人，被孤立者)?

Believe it or not, we’re angels.

I’m gonna go outside and pretend(伪装，假装；) to use my cell phone.

Go.

Oh!

Can I have your jacket?

Yeah.

Okay.

Are you coming to bed?

I’ll be up in a bit.(我一会儿就上去)

Don’t stay up(不睡觉，熬夜) all night.

No, I’ll be right there.(我马上就来)

Thanks so much.

I’ll call you.

Wait.

I thought you had a good time.

I did.

I loved it.

I’ve never been before.

Well, maybe I could come up.(也许我能上去坐坐)

Oh.

Brian, you’re so sweet.

Really.

But if I was gonna fuck you, you’d know.

Thanks so much.

She’s here.

Send her in.

It’s quite rare for a president’s chief of staff to climb(攀登，攀爬；) the Hill.(亲临国会)

A gesture of respect(尊敬，敬重), no doubt, or desperation(绝望，拼命；急需，渴求).

I’m guessing she’ll say Donald Blythe for Education.

Let’s see if I’m right.

Good morning, Linda.

Thank you so much for making the trip up.

Of course.

My pleasure.

Education?

First things first.

The seating chart for the inauguration(就职典礼；开幕式；开创).

How do these two work for you and Claire?

Wow.

They come with a complimentary(赞美的，表示钦佩的；免费赠送的) set of tickets to the Jefferson Ball.

Claire will be over the moon(兴高采烈；欣喜若狂).

Good, I’m so glad.

So, education.

We have Donald Blythe drafting the legislation(法规，法律；立法，制订法律).

Donald Blythe?

Jesus.

I know.

So you want a bill just two steps left of Karl Marx?(你想要一个比马克思还左的法案吗？)

I advised the President-elect against it, but Donald is the face of education.(教育界代表人物)

He’s been pushing reform(改革) for 25 years.

You want me to guide him to the middle.

We need a bill we can pass.

Do I have absolute autonomy(自治，自治权；) and authority(专家，权威人士；行政管理机构；权利，权限) on this?

There’s more.

Garrett wants the bill on the floor in the first 100 days.(加乐特想在就职百天内对法案进行投票)

He wants to make a pledge(誓言，保证，承诺；捐款承诺；) in his inaugural(（演说）就职的，就任的) address.

That’s…

That’s very ambitious(有抱负的，野心勃勃的；), Linda.

Can we make that pledge?

A hundred days?

I can deliver.

Keep me posted.(保持联系)

I’ll talk with Donald.

I’ll check in(报到，记录；到达并登记) with you later in the week.(我会在晚些时候和你联系)

Terrific(极好的，了不起的；极大的，惊人的).

Did you smell that?

The smugness(洋洋自得；自视甚高；自命清高；装模作样)?

The false deference(尊重，遵从)?

She thinks I can be bought(收买) with a pair of tickets.

What am I?

A whore(娼妓，妓女；) in post-war Berlin salivating(使流涎；使过量分泌唾液) over free stockings(（女式）长筒袜；) and chocolate?

What she’s asking will cost far more than that.

Ferguson?(弗格森)

Too old.

Willis?

Too stupid.

Boyd? Too queer(奇怪的，异常的；<非正式>男同性恋的).

Really?

He’s married with three kids.

And wouldn’t they be devastated(毁坏，破坏；使极度震惊，使伤心欲绝).

All right.

What about Catherine Durant?

Cathy Durant.

She was vocally(用声音；口头地) anti-Walker.

She’s got the experience.

Set up a meeting.

Hey.

The donation(捐赠物，捐赠，赠送) from SanCorp?

The money will have to come from somewhere else.

What happened?

I’ve looked over the budget for fiscal(政府）财政的；<美>财政年度的；<美>金融的) 13 and we’ve allocated $1.6 million for salaries.

We need to cut that in half.

You’re suggesting…

Evelyn, we’re going to let some people go.

That would be half of our staff.

We have to carve(雕，刻；切下，割下；) out some room.(我们必须腾出些位置)

You would have to fire some essential(必不可少的，非常重要的) people who have been with us since the beginning.

We are a charity(慈善组织，慈善机构), but not for our employees.

You know, Claire, I’ve held my tongue about this whole international thing for a while, but I don’t get it.

We are really good at what we do.

Why do we have to try and be something we’re not?

Because we’ve plateaued(趋于平稳，进入停滞期), Evelyn.

And it is time for us, for our entire organization…

But digging(搜寻，寻找；<非正式，旧>喜欢；挖，掘) wells(井；源泉) in Africa?

We don’t know anything about that.

Which is why we have to bring in new people.

This is the plan that I’ve proposed(提议；计划) to the board and we are moving forward with it.

I’d like a list of names, please.

Claire, can we just think about this?

I have thought about it.

I’ve put a lot of thought into it.

But I think…

Evelyn, you’re the office manager.

I need you to trust that I know what I’m doing.

So please get me that list as soon as possible.

Ma’am.

You can’t go up.

I’m sorry.

I just have one question.

No.

No.

Sir, I apologize, this woman…

Congressman.

Miss, you need to step away from the door.

If I could just have one second.(我只打扰一小会)

Step away from the…

Who are you?

My name is Zoe Barnes.

I’m a reporter at the Washington Herald(预兆；使者，先驱).

It is after 10:30 at night and this is my home.

I do not allow… We’re part of a mutual(相互的，彼此的) admiration(钦佩，赞美) society.

You’re a fan of the symphony(交响乐；<美>交响乐团).

One more for the people-watching than the music.

It’s all right, Steve.

Come on in, Ms. Barnes.

It’s strong.(这酒很烈)

You’d prefer(更喜爱，宁可) it weak?

No, the stronger the better.

There’s no harm(伤害，损害) in looking.

That’s a cheap ploy(策略；活动；工作).

It’s cheap but effective(产生预期结果的，有效的).

Well, you certainly have my undivided(专心的；专一的) attention.

Good, the reason I’m here…

Oh…

Is foreplay(前戏) over?

I read somewhere that JFK never lasted more than three minutes.

The point being?

Time is precious(宝贵的，珍贵的；珍视的，重要的).

Powerful people don’t have the luxury(奢华，华贵；奢侈品；不常有的乐趣，难得的享受) of foreplay.

Okay.

So why are you here, Ms. Barnes?

I need somebody I can talk to.

We’re talking.

Tell me what we’re talking about.

I protect your identity, I print whatever you tell me.

And I’ll never ask any questions.

And what makes you think I don’t already have such an arrangement with one of your colleagues?

Because if you did, you wouldn’t have let me through the door.

I’ve led a very long, very successful career avoiding this sort of intrigue(密谋策划，阴谋) with the press(媒体).

I can’t see any advantage in starting now.

But is there any disadvantage(不利条件，劣势；不利因素；损失，损害)?

Sloppiness(凌乱；马虎), for one.

I promise you absolute discretion(谨慎，慎重).

So we’re talking about trust.

Use whatever word you like.(随便你怎么说)

Words matter very much(怎么说很重要), Ms. Barnes.

You should care more about them, given your profession(职业).(鉴于你的职业)

Then yes, your trust.

So which Zoe Barnes am I to trust?

The one who wrote about the fireman that married the meter(米) maid(女仆)?(处理违章停车的女警察)

Or the one who authored(授权；任命) a very fine article on a new jogging(慢跑锻炼；轻推) path in Rock Creek Park.

Don’t be flattered.(奉承，讨好；使高兴，使感到荣幸)

I read everything.

I’m better than what they have me doing.

You know what that feels like.

Do I?

You would have made a great Secretary of State.

How exactly may I help you, Ms. Barnes?

You must know the administration’s(管理，行政；管理部门，行政部门) legislative(立法的；（与）立法机关（有关）的) agenda(待议事项，议事日程).

What’s coming up first.

I may.

Will you tell me?

What would be your guess?

Education.

Why?

Immigration(移民（入境）；移民人数) is too controversial(有争议的，引发争论的).

Tax-reform isn’t sexy enough.(不够劲爆)

Everyone can get behind children.(关于孩子的能得到所有人的支持)

Is it education?

You might very well think that.

I couldn’t possibly comment.

A hint(暗示，提示).

It’s late, Ms. Barnes.

Can we talk again?

I hope you’ll understand that I want to sleep on all this.

I never make such big decisions so long after sunset and so far from dawn(拂晓，黎明；).

My cell phone’s on the back.

Did you put Ms. Barnes in the visitors’ ledger(收支总账，分类账簿)?

Not yet. Don’t. Needless to say.

Needless.

Hello.

Claire, this is Ms. Zoe Barnes, of the Washington Herald.

She was just leaving.

Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Underwood.

Drive safe.

There’s a lot of ice on the road.

I will.

Thank you.

Does that work on anybody?

Does what?

The push-up(隆胸的) bra and the V-neck T?

Well, if it does, I don’t know who they are.

Okay.

Relax, relax.

License and registration(登记，注册，挂号；登记证，注册证).

The glove(手套) compartment(隔层，分隔间), sweetheart.

This isn’t your driver’s license. It’s a Starbucks card.

Oh, shit.

Sorry.

Sir, have you been drinking?

No, I never drink coffee at this hour.

I’m going to need you to step out of the car.

If I was speeding, you can write me a ticket…

Sir, step out of the car right now.

Look, I don’t want to be a prick(蠢材，笨蛋，讨厌的家伙), but I’m a member of Congress.

I don’t care if you’re the King of China.

China doesn’t have a king.

It’s a communist(共产主义的) oligarchy…(寡头政治)

Let’s go.

Out.

You too, sweetie.

Fuck, that is hard to say.

Hello? Good.

Well, let’s get him out.

Mind if I join you?

What the fuck is going on?

I thought I was meeting…

No.

You’re meeting me.

It’s 4:00 in the goddamn(该死的；讨厌的；受诅咒的) morning.

I’ve got a city council(委员会，理事会) meeting in… You’ve been police commissioner(政府部门的）首长，长官) for what, almost a decade now?

We’re here to talk about my resume(简历，履历)?

Mayor(镇长，市长) of D.C. would look good on that resume, wouldn’t it?

We know that you’ve been angling(调整……的角度；斜向地行进) to run for some time.

Experience is your strong suit.

Endorsement(背书，票据签字；) and fundraising(资金筹集，募捐) are not.

We can help with that.

Russo, you’re free to go.

It was just a few drinks.

It was enough to get pulled over.

I wasn’t drunk-drunk. Were you alone?

Yes.

Say it to my face.

Watch the road.

Say it to my face!

Yes, I was alone!

You cannot keep doing this, Peter.

It’s going to catch up with you.(它会让你吃不了兜着走)

I know.

Do you think we can arrange two more at our table for the Jefferson Ball?

For whom?

The Holburns.

Why on earth would you want them there?

I’m going to need her money for the CWI.

The staff cuts are just not enough.

I’ll talk to Vasquez.

How’re we doing?

Good.

Progress.

Irons in the fire.(铁烧的正热)

I like irons.

But I love fire.

Yes…

What are you…

The bill is garbage, Donald.

Tax increases?

Ban on vouchers?

Federal oversight(监督；失察，疏忽)?

How do you expect me to get that through a committee?

When Linda told me to write it, she promised…

I’m sure she said any number of things.

Forget what they promised you, Donald.

They want your name because it carries weight.

Well, my name comes with my ideas.(我的名声来自我的想法)

I understand, but you’ve got to be reasonable(有道理的，合情理的；).

This isn’t the Great Debate(讨论，辩论).

It’s about passing meaningful(有意义的，重要的) reform.

Maybe not everything you would hope.

But help me help you.

That’s gonna take time.

Those ideas, I’ve been developing them for…

If it’s time you need, I will buy you time.

But you’ve got to promise me your next at bat is gonna give me something I can work with.

Okay, Frank, I’ll see what I can do.

Good.

And, Donald, don’t let this get you down.

Together, we’re going to do more than you’ve been able to do in 25 years.

Two things are now irrelevant.

Donald Blythe and Donald Blythe’s new draft.

Eventually, I’ll have to re-write the bill myself.

Forward, that is the battle-cry(呐喊；战斗口号).

Leave ideology(意识形态，思想体系) to the arm-chair generals(将军；上将). It does me no good.

Walker just nominated(提名；任命) Kern.

It’s a long road to confirmation.

Kern is a boy scout(童子军).(科恩身份清白)

Nobody’s a boy scout.

Not even Boy Scouts.

What do you have?

Absolutely nothing.

Then what are we talking about?

Just asking a simple question, does the job interest you?

Why would you want Michael gone?

Cathy, you and I came up together.

The Foreign Affairs Committee needs a secretary we can work with.

Someone who isn’t afraid to stand up to Walker when he’s wrong.(不怕站出来反驳沃克的错误)

We need you.

Let’s assume(假定，假设) I am interested.

I don’t want to assume.

I want to know.

2…

Okay.

2-6-3-7.

Please hold.

Zoe Barnes.

Anywhere you want.

On my way.

I’ll gonna have to call you back.

I’m so sorry.

I couldn’t catch a cab.

I had to take a train and I…

Just before you left my house.

Think back.

What were we discussing?

The president’s legislative agenda.

Specifically(特意，专门地；明确地，具体地).

Education.

Was I right?

Do the math(考虑一下, 盘算一下, 做数学题), Ms. Barnes.

He needs a bill.

Sponsored(倡议，提交) by?

You?

Be smarter than that.

Somebody with legitimacy(合法性，合理性, 权威).

Good.

And who screams(高声喊, 尖叫) “legitimacy” in Education?

Donald Blythe?

Correct.

The problem is…

He’s an old-school tax-and-spend liberal(思想开明的；自由主义的，支持变革的).(他说一个支持高税收高支出的左派)

Walker ran as a moderate(普通的，中等的；不偏激的，温和的).

You think Blythe would talk to me?

He doesn’t have to.

Wait…

We’re in a very gray area, ethically(合乎伦理地；伦理上), legally(按照法律，法律上；合法地), which I’m okay with…

I just love this painting, don’t you?

We’re in the same boat now, Zoe.

Take care not to tip it over.(小心点别翻了)

I can only save one of us from drowning(压过，盖过；沉浸于，淹没于；（使）淹死).

He announces(宣布，公布；声称) his education initiative(措施，倡议；) on Monday.

Half of the address(演讲，演说) is…

I understand.

Do we need to take it out?

We’re fine, Linda.

But you just got through saying he has to start over.

I didn’t choose Blythe.

You did.

You put him in my lap(大腿面，膝上) and asked me to work a miracle(奇迹，不可思议的事), and I will.

Now, have a little faith, Linda.

Let me work with Donald on this.

I know what can be accomplished(完成，实现) in 100 days.

All right, Frank, we’re counting on(指望；依靠) you.

Good.

Now, I do have a little favor(帮助；提拔；) to ask.

Do you think I can get just two more tickets for my table at the Jefferson Ball? 

Drink?

Sure, what do you got? 

Whiskey.Blends(混合，混杂；交融).

If you’re offering.

So, how are things in the City of Brotherly Love?

We’re getting by.

Good, good.

I’m sorry, I made that neat(整齐的；爱整洁的；巧妙的，简洁的).

Did you want…

No, this is perfect.

So, it seems you’ve been a bit irresponsible(不负责任的，不可靠的).

What?

Don’t play dumb(哑的，不能说话的) with me, Peter.

Save it for the ethics(行为准则，道德原则；伦理学，道德学) committee.

Drink up, you could use a little courage(勇气，胆量) right now.

You’re not having one?

It’s a bit early in the day for me.

Is this about the other night?

How do you know about that?

I’m the Whip.

It’s my job to know.

Look, they let me off.

There’s no charges.

It’s all taken care of.

Honestly, Peter, do you really think these things just take care of themselves?(你真以为这种事自己就能解决?)

You… It was just this one time, Frank.

I swear(宣誓，起誓) to God.

Then you must hold God in very low esteem(尊重，敬重), because we both know that’s a lie.

Solicitation(恳求；教唆；诱惑), controlled substances(物品药物), driving under the influence(影响，作用)…

You’ve got quite a long list of hobbies(兴趣爱好).

What is it you want?

Your absolute, unquestioning loyalty(忠诚，忠贞).

Always. Do not misunderstand what I mean by loyalty.

Anything.

Name it(说吧), Frank.

You seem far too relaxed.(你看起来太随意了)

I’m not.

You shouldn’t be.

Doug will be in touch.

Hang on.

Where have you been?

I’ve been calling you.

Everybody’s working double-time on inauguration and you just up and disappear…

Hang on.(不挂断)

Let me call you back.

Where did you get this?

Wrong question.

The right question is how quickly can we get it up on the site?

I have to run this past Tom.

Let’s get legal on this,(我们先咨询一下律师) make sure we’re not breaking any laws.

You won’t tell me your source?

I can’t do that.

Fine.

But if legal finds even one…

I understand.

How long do you think that will take?

We should get this online right away.

I’m not just going to scan a 300-page document and put it up before we’ve gone through every…

I did that already.

The whole thing?

Cover to cover.(从头到尾)

I’ve got excerpts(摘由，节选).

Analysis.

3,000 words ready for editing.

You start going over that.

Get graphics working on tables, charts, the whole nine yards.

Janine! What’s the angle, five words?

Far left of center.

That’s four.

Very far left of center.

Enough to put Walker on his heels?(足够沃克着急？)

Fuck his heels.

This will put him on his ass.(让他如坐针毡)

What’s up?

We’ve got a copy of the administration’s education bill.

You’re going to work with Zoe, do background copy(做背景调查).

Zoe Barnes?

Right here.

Whatever she needs.

Shouldn’t I be writing the…

She wrote it already.

And I want you to re-write it, then re-write it again.

You’ll help her.

Tom, I’m your chief political correspondent(记者，通讯员；通信者，写信人).

Go.

I want this by tomorrow.

But I need to focus on the inauguration.

This is more important.

Let’s get started.

…that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States.

“…that I will faithfully(忠实地，忠诚地；) execute the office…”

Power is a lot like real estate(财产，遗产).

It’s all about location, location, location.

The closer you are to the source, the higher your property(所有物，财产) value.

Centuries from now, when people watch this footage(一组（电影，电视）镜头；（以英尺表示的）尺码，长度), who will they see smiling just at the edge of the frame?

“So help me God.”

Congratulations.

Today is not about the next four years.

It’s about the next four decades.

You’ve placed your faith in me, and I, in turn, choose to place that faith in our children.

Our children are the key to this nation’s future, and that’s why the first order of business for this administration will be a comprehensive(综合性的，全面的；有理解力的) education reform bill to properly(正确地，适当地；得体地，恰当地) fix, finance(提供资金) and strengthen our nation’s schools.

And I pledge to you, we will have that bill on the floor of the Congress within the first 100 days of this administration.

It was so nice of you to make this possible.

When you called me, I was…

Not another word.

I’m going to miss out on my ultimate(最终的，最后的) Frisbee(弗里斯比飞盘) league(联合会，联赛) this season.

No, I’m serious(认真的，严肃的).

A few of us on Budget have quite a rivalry(竞争，较量) going with the guys on Finance.

It’s fierce(强烈的，激烈的).

We get physical(身体的，肉体的).(我们都动手了)

Anybody gets between me and that goal line, I will take that sucker(（不指名的）人（或事）) down.

Donald, I’ve been looking for you everywhere, maestro(大师；名家；大音乐家).

Yeah.

Let me help you out there.

I really like the work you’ve done on the new draft.

It’s a big step forward. We’re going to make history together.

Thanks for your encouragement(鼓励), Francis.

Listen, I’ve got some ideas about subsidies…(补助金，补贴，津贴)

Catherine!

Hold on to that thought(回头再说), Donald.

Don’t you look stunning.

We Southern girls clean up well when we get out of our Daisy Dukes and into some Vera Wang.

And we Southern boys are slow with our words, but we’re fast on our feet.

May I have the honor?

You most certainly may.

Morning, Freddy.

Mornin’, Frank.

How’s tricks(花招，诡计，骗局)?(生意好吗)

Can’t kick(踢，踢腿).(凑合吧)

You want to go on in?

No, why don’t you set me up outside?

Outside?

It’s freezing(极冷的；冰点以下的，冰冻的) out here.

Well, a little cold never hurt anybody.

Anything you say, Frank.

It’ll be right up.

My one guilty(有罪的；内疚的) pleasure(快乐，满足，欣慰) is a good rack(架子，支架) of ribs(肋骨；排骨（肉），肋条（肉）).

Even at 7:30 in the morning.

I have the whole place to myself.

Freddy sometimes opens up just for me.

Where I come from in South Carolina, people didn’t have two pennies to rub(擦，磨擦；揉擦) together.

A rack of ribs was a luxury, like…

…Christmas in July.

This web traffic is absolutely crazy.

…blue Camry’s wanted in connection to a canine(犬；[解剖]犬齿) hit-and-run.

Hey, is this your car?

What’s going on?

You want seconds, Frank?

I better not.

Tell you what, Freddy.

Yes, I will.

I’m feeling hungry today.

## Chapter 2

You know what I like about people?

They stack(一堆；<英> 垛，堆；大量，许多) so well.(他们会排队)

Let me get this for you.

Want the paper?

No. This is too much.

It’s not half enough.

Thanks for opening up for me.

Any time, day or night.

You know that.

In a town where everyone’s so carefully reinventing(彻底改造，重新创造；以新形象示人) themselves, what I like about Freddy is that he doesn’t even pretend(伪装，假装) to change.

Ooh.

I’m late.

Every Tuesday I sit down with the speaker(议长) and the majority leader to discuss the week’s agenda(待议事项，议事日程).

Well, discuss is probably the wrong word.

They talk while I sit quietly and imaging their lightly salted(盐的；盐腌的；有经验的) faces frying(油煎，油炸) in a skillet(煮锅；长柄平底煎锅).

Vasquez must be shitting(拉屎；意外地拉屎；非常害怕；取笑，欺骗（某人）；恶劣对待) herself.(瓦斯奎滋肯定被吓得拉裤子了)

Shitting herself,or Walker is shitting himself and shoveling(铲起，铲去) his shit on her shit.

Bob, I’m planning on eating.

Do we have a backup on the docket(摘要；记事表)?

You’re on that, right, Frank?

Yeah, I’m working with my staff

Republicans are gonna ram(猛撞，猛击) this up our ass(傻瓜，笨蛋；屁股，臀部；<旧>驴；性感的人).

I would if I was them. Why, even if we squeak(吱吱叫，嘎吱作响；紧张（或激动）得尖声说；<非正式>勉强通过，侥幸成功) it through the house, watch them mangle(乱砍；轧布；损坏) it in the senate(参议院；大学理事会).

Or filibuster(阻碍议案通过).

Why, sure, if it looks anything like this.

I don’t know why Walker’s trying to tackle(应付，解决) a charging(猛攻，冲锋) elephant.

It’s madness(疯狂；愚蠢的行为).

Congressmen, sorry to interrupt, but I saw you sitting over here.

Remy.

Gentlemen, this is Remy Danton.

Remy, this is Speaker Birch and Congress

I’m well aware(知道的，明白的).

Mr. Speaker, Congressman.

Remy just made partner at Glendon Hill.

Glendon Hill?

Great team over there.

Congratulations.

Thank you.

When was the last time they added a partner?

It’s been a while.

Well, they know a winner when they see one.

Remy was the best press secretary I ever had.

Why did you let him go?

I didn’t.

They stole him away.

What accounts do you have?

San Corp Industries is my main one.

I run that account now.

Anyhow, I’ll let you get back to it.

Sorry again to interrupt.

No problem.

Very nice to meet you both.

Nice.

Lobbyists(游说者) keep getting younger and younger.

He’s probably making more than all of us combined(联合的，共同的；总和的，总计的).

Gentlemen, this one’s on me.

I’m gonna track down that check.

Glendon Hill fronts San Corp Industries.

San Corp is deep into natural gas.

I don’t give a hoot(鸣响；嘲骂声；汽笛响声) about natural gas, but I have 67 deputy(代理人，副手，副职) whips, and they all need cash to win races.

San Corp helps me purchase(<正式>购买，采购) loyalty(忠诚，忠贞), and in return they expect mine.

It’s degrading(有辱人格的，贬低身份的), I know, but when the tit’s(乳头；山雀；各种小鸟；小马；少妇；轻打) that big, everybody gets in line.

Tell them I’m on top of it.

I need more than that.

You are well aware that I do not drop the ball on things like this, Remy.

Promises, Frank.

Secretary of State, Argentine and offshore drilling contracts([经]合同；[法]契约).

talk to me when I’ve solved the problem.

Don’t waste my time when I’m working on solving the problem.

When there’s billions on the line, You can’t not call me back. I can't not show up.

Fine.

Thank you for your diligence(勤奋，用功；公共马车).

Eight figures to you and the triple(三倍的，三重的) DC.

6 million to build that library of yours in your name.

I know.

Don’t make them throw money at your challenger next cycle.

You’ve made your point.

Have I?

I hope so.

Such a waste of talent.

He chose money over power

In this town, a mistake nearly everyone makes.

Money is the McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after ten years.(金钱就像。。。保质期只有10年)

Power is the old stone building that stands for centuries.

I cannot respect someone who doesn’t see the difference.

[Frank] What am I looking at?

The Williams register.

Williams?

College.

September ’78.

And why am I looking at it?

The editorial(社论，社评).

Not that interesting.

Michael Kern went to Williams.

Check out the masthead.

And then there’s this.

It’s thin.

The guy’s a unicorn(独角兽).

He pisses(<忌，俚>撒尿；<忌，俚>尿，小便) rainbows(彩虹).

You think we can get traction(拖，拉，牵引，拉力，牵引力) with this?

I think you could.

Linda Vasquez is on the phone.

Ah, I’m surprised it took her this long.

It’s only 6 past 9:00. Which means she read the Herald 3 hours ago and spent the past 2 1/2 getting reamed by the president.

Tell her I’m on my way.(告诉她我马上就来)

You were supposed(推断，料想，猜想) to keep Donald in line.

You assured(使确信，向……保证) me that you...

25 years he’s been pushing this particular agenda.

We got between the mother bear and her cub(幼兽).

It’s a setback(挫折，阻碍).

That’s all.

On our first day in office.

Linda, I’ve worked with four presidents.

Setbacks are a dime(小钱，少量的钱) a dozen(一打，十二个；大量，许多) with a bill of this size.

Frank, if you can’t control this.

I don’t take well to being micromanaged(微观管理), Linda.

You want to do my job for me and run the White House?

Good luck.

I won’t stand in your way.(我绝不阻拦)

Okay, Frank.

Fine.

This is yours now.

If this thing can’t make it to the floor in the first 100 days, then I’ll let you explain to the president why he lied to the American people.

I’m gonna get back to work. Please do.

Well, we really should be doing this on a Friday instead of a Wednesday.

If we do it on a Friday, - people have the weekend– - Fine.

We’ll do it on Friday.

[Claire] Is all the paperwork ready?

Some of the more senior people are trickier(难对付的，棘手的；狡猾的，诡计多端的).

There’s severance.

But we shouldn’t run into any legal issues.

No, no.

We use at-will(随意；任意) employment contracts across the board.

Well, get started first thing Friday.

I want all of the exit interviews done by lunch.

Claire, I just can’t help but think that this is a mistake.

We’ve discussed this already, Evelyn.

I know, I know, but I just have to say it for the sake(利益，好处；目的) of my conscience(良知，良心；内疚，愧疚).

I think that you are dismantling(拆开，拆卸；废除，取消) what we have built over the past ten years, and I– and I think the way you’re handling this is…is cruel(残酷的，残忍的).

It’s not easy, Evelyn.

But it’s necessary.

You have always asked me to be honest with you.

It’s how we work together.

I disagree with something, I say it.

Well, I disagree 100%.

Please, Claire, don’t do this.

I respect your opinion, Evelyn, and I appreciate you sharing it with me, but I’m not going to change my mind.

Friday, then.

If that’s what you want.

This is major reform, a complete overhaul(大修，彻底检修；（制度或方法的）全面改革).

That would usually take months.

Well, we only have days, not months.

But think about the process.

We can’t just change– 

When I ask my colleagues, your bosses, who are the smartest minds in education, out of hundreds, we arrived at you– the six of you in this room.

Now, I realize it is a difficult task, but we have the opportunity to make history here.

And I want all of us to make it together.

So good luck.

We’re counting on you.

Page 1.

These bullet(子弹，弹丸；（标示用的）黑圆点) points reflect(反射（光、热或声音）；反映，照出（影像）) the key planks(（政策或纲领的）要点) at the center of our bill.

Get comfy(舒服的；轻松的（等于 comfortable）).

This is your home until we have a presentable(漂亮的；可见人的；有规矩的) first draft.

Donald, what a morning.

I have no idea how they got this.

I specifically told my staff to destroy everything.

I can’t imagine– It doesn’t matter how it happened. We can’t make it unhappen, so we have to adapt(适应；调整，使适合).

Don’t they realize that this is a first draft?

All we have here really is a perception(看法，认识；感觉，感知；) problem.

We don’t get a second chance at a first impression, Donald.

You know that.

Now, look, I’m on your side, but Linda is furious(狂怒的，暴怒的).

What’s she saying?

They want to point fingers.(他们需要替罪羊)

At me?

I told her we cannot do that.

I mean, you are vital to this process.

I’m up to here with them(我收购他们了), Donald– for lying, for turning their back on you.

You know, I’m of a mind to say screw(<非正式>见鬼去) it.

I’ll fall on this grenade(手榴弹；灭火弹) myself, just to piss them off(立即走开；使……讨厌).

Give me John king at CNN.

Wait, Frank.

This is not your fault.

No, we have to protect your reputation(名誉，名声).

But you’re the man that needs to get the bill through the house.

I will– hang on.

I will assign it to one of my deputies, quietly manage it, and help guide you through the process.

I am not comfortable with this.

Well, then what do you suggest we do?

[Sigh] What a martyr(殉道者，烈士) craves(渴望；<旧>恳求，请求) more than anything is a sword(剑，刀；<文> 武力，暴力) to fall on, so you sharpen the blade(刀片，刀刃), hold it at just the right angle, and then 3, 2, 1 

It should be me.

It was my bill.

No.

Impossible.

Donald, education has been your life’s work.

[Grunt] The truth is my heart is not in this fight.

You know me.

I’m not a wheeler(车夫；辕马；车轮制造人) dealer.

I can put my mind to policy, but I’m no good at this brand of politics.

Well, if not you, then who?

[Clock chimes] It should be you, Frank.

You’re formidable(可怕的，令人敬畏的).

People respect you.

They will follow your lead.

Let me– let me be on the sidelines for this.

Well, I could only consider that as an option if I knew that I could still come to you for counsel(忠告，建议；).

Of course.

Whatever you need.

[Sigh] Part of me is glad this got leaked.

Well, it would have been better if it hadn’t, but at least people know where I stand.

Thank you, Donald.

Happy to do it, Frank.

He has no idea we’ve got six kids in the next room already working on a new draft.

Stamper! But why dampen(使潮湿，弄湿；减弱，抑制) his mood(心境，情绪；气氛) by telling him?

We just gave him a great gift– a chance to fulfill his destiny(命运，定数；天意，命运之神).(一个机会让他能完成使命)

Write up a statement for Blythe– stepping aside(在旁边，到（或向）一边), fresh ideas, et cetera, et cetera, and make it dignified(使有尊严，使高贵；使显得堂皇，抬高……的身价
).

He’s a good man.

Oh.

And bring me that Williams editorial(社论，社评).

After careful thought and discussion with my staff, I am relinquishing(（尤指不情愿地）放弃，交出（权力、职位等）) my management of the education reform act.

I hope to remain a part of the process, but I won’t be working– Why did you leak the draft?

I’m not exactly sure how it got leaked, but, uh, it does represent– it came from your office, though, correct?

Uh, we wrote it, but I don’t– Who’ll be managing the bill now?

Frank Underwood.

Was that your choice, or did the administration– I feel very confident(自信的，充满信心的；坚信的，肯定的) placing the bill in Frank’s capable(有能力的；有本领的，能干的) hands.

[Dialing] [Line ringing] Ms. Barnes.

How very deep throat(喉咙，咽喉) of you.

Well, I can’t help you dispatch a president.

How about a senator?

The editorial((社论，社评)) on the Camp David accords(戴维营协议).

It is the opinion of this newspaper.

that President Carter demand(强烈要求；需要，需求) Israel withdraw(停止提供，不再给予； 退出，不参加；) all its citizens from the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
Which it has illegally occupied(占用，居住) since 1967.

Illegally occupied.

That’s quite an incendiary(纵火的；煽动性的) quote, don’t you think?

For an administration that says that the Middle East is its top foreign policy priority.

Michael Kern?

Did he personally write the editorial?

He was the editor.

But did he write it himself?

Then there’s no story.

I’m saying it’s a question worth asking.

And if he denies(否认；拒绝承认；拒绝给予) involvement(涉及)?

He will. Let him.

This is a man trying to be confirmed as Secretary of State.

Everything is a story.

There’s no direct link.

I can’t get this past Messerschmidt.

Remember this moment when you resisted(阻挡，抵制；抵抗，回击) me, when you said the words “Then there is no story.”

Get a good night’s sleep, Ms. Barnes.

You have a big day tomorrow.

[Door opens, closes] Francis?

What is this?

What does it look like?

But the basement(地下室，地库) is mine.

I know.

It’s not for me.

So who’s it for?

For you.

There’s a gym(体育馆，健身房) in the Capitol.

Which you never use.

Because I’m a tad busy running the country.

But not at home, so now you have no excuse.

I want it out.

Give it a try first.

Is this your subtle(不易察觉的，微妙的；敏锐的，有洞察力的) way of saying that I’m out of shape?

No, it’s my way of suggesting you could be in better shape.

That sounds both passive-aggressive(消极反抗的，消极对抗的) and condescending(屈尊；俯就；（对某人）表现出优越感).

Just plain aggressive(好斗的，挑衅的；积极进取的) and true.

Don’t wait up for me.

Are you going running now?

Yes, because I couldn’t this morning.

I had an early meeting.

Use the monstrosity(畸形；可怕的东西；残暴).

It’s freezing out. You break it in(你先来).

It looks positively(绝对地；乐观地；赞成地) medieval(中世纪的), doesn’t it?

And to turn my only sanctuary(避难权，庇护；避难所，庇护所) into a fitness dungeon(地牢，土牢).

I won’t have it. 

It’s a stretch(言过其实的话；).

[Zoe] We’re not misleading anyone.

He was the editor.

Did you call for a comment? I tried three times.

The press secretary said he’d get back to me.

He didn’t.

What about research?

You couldn’t find anything to echo the editorial?

No quotes, no op-ed(（报纸的）专栏版，特写稿版（opposite editorial page）) pieces?

Don’t you think if something like that existed, someone would have printed it by now?

Nobody else has this, Lucas.

I don’t think there’s a story here.

I’m not saying there’s a story.

All I’m saying is that there’s a question that needs to be answered.

This is a nominee(被提名者，被任命者) for Secretary of State.

We have an editorial on Palestine and Israel.

Which he didn’t write.

Which we don’t know he didn’t write.

Exactly.

We don’t have to print it.

I could just scan the thing, stick(粘，贴；) it on a site, and tweet the link. But if I did that, some other paper might...

Whoa, whoa.

Don’t be a bitch.

I’ll talk to Tom.

That’s all I was asking.

We simply can’t afford to allow the.

We got a guy who’s almost perfect.

He’s a libertarian(自由意志主义者；行动自由论者) drug fiend - marinating(用调料腌渍) in a mobile home(房车).

Shh.

I didn’t agree with President Reagan on many things, but there was some merit(优秀品质，价值) to the notion(概念，想法) of trickle-down(所谓渗滴式涓滴效应) economics, and I feel there is much merit to the idea of trickle-down diplomacy(外交，外交技巧).

Those are my lines.

Vasquez must have given them to him.

…stalemate between Israel and Palestine, that success will trickle down to a hundred other diplomatic(外交的，从事外交的) dilemmas(窘境，困境) between Muslims, Jews(犹太人，犹太教徒), Christians(基督徒，信徒)

I’m glad you brought up Israel and Palestine because just before we came on the air, I received an advance copy of an article that’s going to be in tomorrow’s Washington Herald’s front page and was written by Zoe Barnes, and in it she quotes an editorial that ran in the Williams college register when you were editor back in September 1978, which called the Israeli presence(出席，存在) in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, quote, an illegal occupation(尤指军队的）占领，控制).

Can I see that?

Sure. Did you write those words, “illegal occupation”?

No. I have no memory of this.

But you were the editor of the paper.

Yes, but– So it couldn’t have gone out without your approval.

No, of course not, but my staff– somebody else usually wrote the, uh, the, uh– and then we’d vote, and if– Did you vote for it?

Honestly, George, I can’t remember.

It was 35 years ago.

So you’re not sure whether or not you supported these words– I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt I did not write these words.

But were they in line with your thinking at the time?

[Laughing] This is ludicrous(滑稽的；荒唐的).

That’s all we need– him laughing.

[George] I know it was a long time ago– Nancy, get me Dennis Mendel of the ADL.

The Middle East is a vital American interest. What you think about the Middle East is relevant(有关的，切题的；正确的，适宜的).

You can look at my voting record.

Every single vote has been in defense(防御，保卫；防御物，防御能力) of Israel– So when did your views change?

What I’m saying to you is my– What’s important now, George, is how I have voted while I have represented the great state of Colorado– I understand that’s your position, but a lot of other people are going to look at it and think what you thought then is relevant as well.

Have you ever changed your views - since college?

I’m not the nominee for Secretary of State.

Uh, even if I did have– It’s golden(真是绝了).

This has not been my views– It’s a bull’s(公牛) eye.(正中靶心)

What were you saying when you came in?

So, ahem, I found a guy who was on the college editorial staff when Kern was there.

This burnout, still pumping(用泵输送；涌出；注入) mimeographed(油印机；油印件) manifestos(宣言，声明) out of a trailer(拖车，挂车) park in the Berkshires.

You’re not planning on talking to him.

Peter Russo. - Good.

[Phone rings] Sounds like a perfect match.

[Ring] Dennis.

Any chance you’re watching Stephanopoulos?

[Toilet flushes] You look sexy when you’re improving the lives of hardworking Pennsylvanians.

Is it the improving lives, or is it these fetching sweat pants?

Move that computer out of the way.

Let me see what that looks like.

Yeah, it’s better with the laptop.

Fuck off.

You’re not paying enough attention to me.

I pay attention to you all day at the office.

Hey, you know, I don’t think I’ve ever seen you brush your teeth before.

Sure you have.

No, I don’t think so.

I know that you do brush, but I don’t think I’ve ever actually witnessed(作证；目睹) it before.

Well, here it is in all its glory(光荣，荣誉).(让你看个够)

Is that my toothbrush?

I don’t know.

Is it?

Yes, it is.

You left it here.

Peter, gross(让人恶心的).

Oh, come on.

We’ve exchanged plenty of fluids(流体，液体).

Ohh. Hey, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. Toothpaste(牙膏).

It’s not toothpaste.

I’m ravished(强夺；强奸；使着迷).

[Muffled] No.

Mm.

[Ringing] Go get it.

I have to take this.

[Scoffs] Ohh.

This is Russo. Yeah.

Right now it’s 12:53.

[Scoffs] [Smacking lips] Okay.

Okay, okay, okay.

[Beeps] I have to go.

[Clears throat]

Is everything okay?

It’s work stuff.

What kind of work stuff?

Congressman Wallinski.

He wants to go over the tax incentive(激励，刺激) stuff we sent him.

Peter, it’s 1:00 in the morning.

[Door opens] Hey, Peter.

[Door closes] [Scoffs] I have meetings tomorrow.

I have a committee hearing.

Congress will survive(活下来，幸存) without you.

Address, directions.

There’s an e-ticket in your name.

Your flight leaves at 6:30.

You should head(朝某特定方向行进) to the airport.

This is coming from Frank?

No.

This is coming from no one.

You have the flu, and you’re calling in sick.

What’s that?

What’s what?

Is that a hickey(器械；唇印)?

Are you whoring(卖淫；（男子）嫖妓) around again?

No.

I have a girlfriend.

Mm. You mean your little office romance.

What do you know about that?

When it comes to your life, Peter, and what I know about it, you should assume(假定，假设，认为) that there’s no such thing as a secret.

Stay in touch(触摸，碰).(保持联系)

You call me on my cell, never at the office.

Good luck.

Knock ’em dead, tiger.

[Keyboard clacking] How are we?

Overtired(累过头的，过度疲劳的), under-caffeinated(含咖啡因的), but we’re making progress.

Less than a week to go.

Yeah. We’ll do our best.

You’ll what?

We’ll get it done.

[Sniffs] Somebody open a window.

It’s rancid(腐臭的；令人作呕的，讨厌的) in here.

[Snoring]

That is what happens when six people don’t shower(淋浴，洗澡) for half a week.

Anything you need other than deodorant(除臭剂，体香剂)?

Yeah, this performance standards thing.(关于绩效标准)

The teachers unions are gonna–

Leave it in.

But we could delete it.

I’ll handle the unions.

What else?

Anything?

Conjugal(婚姻的；结婚的；夫妻之间的) visits?

I’ll get back to work.

[Keyboard clacking]

Nancy.

Coming.

What do I have next?

Constituent(选民；成分，构成要素) calls from 2:10 to 2:35, - fundraising(资金筹集，募捐) until 3:50, deputy caucus(干部会议；核心会议) at 4:00.

The call list? - It’s on your desk.

My briefing(情况介绍会；简报) for the caucus?

Next to the call list.

Have you been in the conference room?

Have it steam cleaned over the weekend.

In the meantime, get those poor kids some Febreze(风倍清（宝洁公司旗下家用除味剂品牌名）) or something.

It’s like a petting zoo.

[Door closes] You gotta see this.

[Man] But were they in line with your thinking at the time?

[Laughing] We do not consider the issue of Israel and Palestine a laughing matter.

And he calls Israel illegal.

Well, he’s an anti-semite(反犹太), and he is wrong.

We would have grave(严峻的，严重的), grave concerns(担心，忧虑) about appointing such a man our next Secretary of State.

[Clicks off] It’s too easy.

[Loud music, cartoon noises on TV] [Exhales forcefully] [Knocking] Roy, hi.

My name is Peter Russo.

Congressman Russo.

I’d like to just speak to you for just a… Sir?

Either you’re lying, and you can fuck off(滚蛋);

or you’re telling the truth, and you can absolutely fuck off.

I saw your web site.

I’m a fan.

And I brought you something.

[Cartoon continues on TV]

Hey, babe, put some clothes on.

What?

We got a guest.

[TV clicks off]

So? Hey.

Put some clothes on.

Ice or no ice?

[Drink pouring]

Uh, no ice.

Good. We don’t have any.

Fuck.

Echo, I told you to put the– - It’s okay.

It’s okay.

[Toilet flushing] I’ll keep your secret if you keep mine.

A congressman, you say?

Right now, I’m just a drinking companion(同伴，伴侣).

Well, all right, companion.

Have yourself a drink.

[Knock on door] Come on in. $10,000.

What will that get me?

I mean, I’m kinky(性变态的；（衣着）异常挑逗的), but I don’t know if I’m the girl you’re looking for.

You’re definitely(肯定地，当然) the girl that I’m looking for.

Excuse me.

All I want for that money is your silence.

My what?

The guy you were with the other night, the one who was arrested, do you know who he was?

You mean the congressman?

There was no congressman.

There was no arrest.

None of that exists.

All that exists is the money sitting right there in front of you.

Do you understand?

Yeah.

Good.

Open your mouth.

Last little bit’s for me.

[Clock ticking] You’re scolding(责骂，斥责) me.

Am I?

You are, silently.

Is it the rowing machine?

You tell me.

It’s the rowing machine.

You haven’t used it.

How do you know I haven’t?

Francis.

You know I don’t like to be managed.

I’m not trying to manage you.

I just don’t want to outlive you by 25 years.

I must walk three miles a day around that Capitol.

I’m constantly on my feet.

And do you know how many calories the brain burns?

I’m not worried about your brain.

It’s your heart we’re talking about.

[Inhales deeply] [Cigarette scraping] Use the machine.

She’s right.

I should take better care of myself.

But it’s the principle.

I won’t be a slave(奴隶，苦工) to anybody or anything you can order with a toll-free number.

[Southern rock] [Inhales deeply] We share the wealth in this republic(共和国，共和政体).

[Snorts] I thought the whole editorial team pitched in(投入；作出贡献).

Sometimes.

Not that time, though.

But he must have written some of it?

No.

That was all me.

[Inhales deeply]

[Continues] What if people thought he wrote it?

Oh, fuck that.

He’s a fraud(欺诈，骗局，诡计；骗子).

Nah, he’s worse than a fraud.

He’s a fucking farce(荒唐的事情，闹剧；滑稽戏（剧本），闹剧（剧本）).

I’ll tell you something.

He used to be even more of a maniac(疯子，躁狂者) than I am.

Chemicals(化学品，化学制品；化学药品；化工产品)?

No. Politics.

Oh, we had some nights, man.

Long conversations, dangerous fucking notions(观念（notion 的复数）；小商品).

Like what?

You name it– OPEC, Pinochet, the fucking Food Stamp Act.

Then the motherland sang her mating(晨祷；（天主教）早课；晨歌) call.

d O say can you– d Next thing, he’s cramming for the bar at Bryn Mawr and snapping on a flag pin(还别上了国旗胸针).

Does Bryn Mawr have a law school?

My point is, he started goose-stepping(以正步走) in the marionette(牵线木偶) parade(游行；列队表演，展示；检阅).

Left, right; red, blue; Democrat, Republican.

We’re all dangling(摇晃) from the same strings.

Take a sledgehammer(大锤；猛烈的打击) to the whole fucking Punch and Judy show.（英国木偶戏Punch and Judy 中的妻子）

That’s what’s required.

Thought you were a patriot(爱国者).

Fuck, yeah.

One of the few.

So what’s wrong with public service?

Public service?

Come on.

You gotta get a grip(紧握；掌握，控制) on who your masters are.(你搞清楚你的老板是谁)

The I.M.F., the World Bank, the Rockefeller Trilateral Commission.

You bankroll(提供资金；提供财务上的资助) their fucking death squads(警察分队；运动（代表）队).

It’s called FEMA; it’s called alcohol(含酒精饮品，酒；酒精，乙醇；醇), tobacco, and firearms(火器，枪炮；轻武器); NATO(北大西洋公约组织（North Atlantic Treaty Organization）); Border Control.

You think Katrina was incompetence(无资格，不胜任；无能力；不适当；不熟练)?

That was highly orchestrated(把……编成管弦乐曲；精心安排，密谋) negligence(疏忽，大意；<法律>玩忽职守).

Look at Waco, Amnesty(大赦，特赦) International, the A.C.L.U. Smokescreens(烟幕；障眼法)– all of them.

Blood on their hands.

Well, exactly.

You want me to lie to the people.

I want you to spare(抽出，拿出（时间、金钱等）；饶恕，赦免；省得，免去) the people another hypocrite(伪君子，伪善者).

What’s in it for you?

[Sighs] Poetic(诗的，诗歌的) justice(公平，正义).

Oh, come on.

You’re one of them.

Can a corporate(公司的；法人的；共同的，全体的) sellout roll a joint(关节；（一般带有骨头的）一大块肉；（两个物体或部分的）接合处，) like this?(政府的探子能卷出这样的大麻吗？)

If I wanted to do this thing, how might I go about that, precisely(精确地，准确地)?

[Door closes] [Clears throat] How did it go?

There were a few tears here and there and some anger, but nothing unexpected.

I’m going to need you to leave us today, too, Evelyn.

I’m sorry.

I just can’t have any doubt about the direction I’m taking.

You just had me fire 18 people.

I know.

I sat across from them in this room, and I had to tell each and every one of– I know.

I am 59 years old.

Nobody hires anybody my age.

I will write you any kind of recommenda– To do what, bag groceries(食品杂货店，食品杂货业；食品杂货)?(收银员)

What am I supposed(预期，推断；假定；认为) to tell my daughter?

I’m sorry, Evelyn.

I truly am. No, you’re not.

You don’t give a fuck.(你压根不在乎)

Eighteen people, Claire.

Nineteen, if you count me.

I have to… I have to call my daughter.

I know today has been tough.

A lot of your colleagues have left, and I owe(欠（钱），负账) you an explanation(解释，说明；解释性说法，说明性文字；理由，原因).

Many of those who left us today helped build the C.W.I. from the ground up, and I’m grateful(感谢的，感激的) to them.

But it is time for us to evolve(进化，演化), and to accomplish this, we had to make hard choices and bring in new people.

That’s what today was about.

You have any questions, my door is always open.

I’m all good for national and metro(地铁，地铁系统；大城市).

We’ve got space for political if we need it.

Janine, anything new on Michael Kern?

The White House is dodging(闪开，躲开).

You can’t get anyone on record?

Not just me. They’re shutting all of us down in the briefings(情况介绍会；简报；详细指示，详情介绍).

No one is giving an inch, even on background.

In the meantime, I’m working on a feature about the administration’s foreign policy agenda(待议事项，议事日程；（政治）议题).

How it shifted from the start of the campaign, - increased D.O.D. spending, and–

we see you, Zoe. I can link Kern directly to the Williams editorial.

What?

I’ve got a guy named Roy Kapeniak who was on the editorial staff when Kern was there. Hey, Twitter twat(<俚>讨厌鬼，蠢材；<俚>女性生殖器), W.T.F.?(搞什么鬼？)

Wait, wait, wait.

Roy what?

Kapeniak.

A classmate of Kern’s.

I have him on record saying Kern wrote every word - of the editorial.

Let’s move this into my office.

Zoe, Lucas. [Door opens] - [Murmuring]

Janine.

Let me– let me, once and for all(一次的), say this definitively(决定性地；最后地): I didn’t author that editorial.

Not a single sentence, word, comma(逗号), or period(<美>句号，句点).

If memory serves me, it was Mr. Kapeniak who wrote it.

Why on earth he’s trying to claim that I did is beyond me.

Let me further say that I’m a strong supporter of the state of Israel.

As the most stable(稳定的，牢固的) country in the region - and our strongest ally…

It’s Frank Underwood for Cathy.

…in any peace process, because without the stability(稳定（性），稳固（性) of Israel, there can be no Palestine.

[Reporters shouting]

CNN right now.

“Without Israel there can be no Palestine”?

I’ve got it on.

I would remind Senator Kern that there was a Palestine long before there was an Israel.

His comments are not only ignorant(无知的，（对某事物）不了解的), they are racist(种族主义者).

Get ready, Cathy.

Things are about to move very quickly.

…his understanding of the Middle East–

Okay.

…is so out of sync with reality…

I’m ready.

[Clears throat] Hey.

Peter?

No.

Stop.

Uh, not now. Hey.

Hey, where have you been?

Oh, God, you’re fucking high.

No. I– - Yes, you are.

Look at your eyes.

Oh, please, just lay off(解雇；休息；停止工作).

You promised me it wouldn’t be like this. 

Cancel whatever I have for the rest of the day. 

[Glass shatters] 
Kern is out.

They’re tossing(扔，抛，掷) him? 

Technically(技术上；专门地), he'd withdraw(退出，不参加) himself, but yes. 

Can I say “A source close to the White House”? 

No. You let this story play out on its own time. 

They’ll announce in the morning. 

I’m sorry. If not that, what story are we talking about? 

Catherine Durant. As soon as Kern withdraws, you say she’ll be the replacement. 

- Is that true? - 

It will be after you write it. 

Roy Kapeniak was you. 

You might very well think that. I couldn’t possibly comment. 

You found him. You had him call me. 

Kapeniak and Kern were appetizers(开胃菜；头盘餐前小品), Miss Barnes. 

Catherine Durant is the meal. Say that name: Catherine Durant. 

Say it over and over. Tomorrow afternoon, write it down, and then watch that name come out of the mouth of the President of the United States. 

This is where we get to create. 

Don’t miss your train, Miss Barnes. It’s the last one tonight. 

Zoe Barnes with the Washington Herald now reporting, quoting(引用，引述；举例说明) a source close to the president, as saying that Senator Catherine Durant will likely be the new nominee for Secretary of State after Michael Kern’s withdrawal earlier this week. 

The White House has remained silent on whether the president will tap Durant for a nomination, but a national Zogby Poll shows wide support for Durant across party lines. 

Catherine Durant has served ten years on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made numerous(众多的，许多的) diplomatic(外交的，从事外交的) missions(任务；代表团) to South America… 

We can place our faith in her, knowing that we have a responsible, experienced, brilliant woman representing our interests abroad. 

Middle of the road, team player, strong in defense. If there’s a woman that can work with the joint(联合的，共同的) chiefs, she’s the one. 

Durant is the way to go. It’s a no-brainer.(傻子都能看出来) The president should stop this pageant(选美（竞赛）) and simply make the call. 

Why are we still talking about, if they’re going to nominate Durant? Why don’t they just do it already so we can all stop talking about ifs and start talking about when and what and how Durant’s going to shape up foreign policy… 

So, history? History. [All sighing] 

I’m very impressed(钦佩的，印象深刻的), Frank. 

Good. With your go-ahead, I’ll start the mock-up. 

Have Birch and Rasmussen seen this? Not yet. I wanted you to be the first to have a look. 

I’ll schedule a time for you to fill in the president. 

Oh, no, no, no. That is your turf(草皮；泥炭；跑马场), Linda. You should do that. - 

Thank you, Frank. - 

My pleasure. Thank you. - 

I so apologize for everything– - 

No, no, no, n– it’s not necessary. 

Now for the real meeting. So what is happening with Michael Kern? 

Oh, it’s a total nightmare(噩梦；可怕的经历). 

You know who you’re gonna tap next? 

Frank, we still need you in the house– 

No, no, no. I wouldn’t dream of it. We’ve got our education bill. I was just curious(好奇的，求知欲强的). 

Somehow(不知为什么) the rumor(谣言；传闻) is flying around that we’re gonna nominate Catherine Durant.  

I’m sure you’ve noticed. 

Is the rumor true? 

Well, we weren’t considering her at first, but the president asked me to have her vetted(仔细检查；彻底审查（某人）) in case we wanna go that route. 

Interesting. 

What do you think? 

Well, she wouldn’t be my first choice

Who would be your first choice? 

She campaigned hard against us in the primaries(初选).

That’s my reservation(保留，保护). 

But you’d show yourself above party politics, and I know she’d work all the harder for it. 

Decent(像样的，尚好的；得体的，合宜的) experience, respect across the aisle(走廊，过道；（教堂）耳堂，侧堂). 

So you think we can seriously consider her? 

It’s not the worst idea in the world. 

[Door closes] [Inhales, exhales] - Where are you getting this shit? 

What? 

Your stories(你的报道). 

Who are you fucking? 

Nobody. 

Oh, come on. You’re a metro scrub(小人物), and now look at you. 

You’d have to be fucking somebody important. 

I’m just doing my job, Janine. Excuse me.(失陪) [Mutters] 

All set.(都搞定了)  

Is this your first remote? 

Yeah, it’s my first time. 

Right into the camera, don’t shift(移动，（使）转移) in your seat, and there’s no reason to speak above a conversational volume. The mic will pick you up. You all ready? 

Yeah. 

All right. 

Don’t forget to breathe. 

Five, four… [No audible dialogue] [Man] 

We’d like to welcome Zoe Barnes from the Washington Herald. Zoe, thank you for joining us. 

I’m very glad to be here. Thank you for having me. 

You broke the education bill, the Kern editorial, and now Durant. 

I’m just thrilled(使（某人）非常兴奋，非常激动) to be reporting news that matters. And it’s truly been a team effort. Everyone at the Herald pitched(投，掷，扔) in. 

But, yes, a lot of firsts. First national story, first… [Whirring] 

Thank you. Calling it a night.(今晚到此为止；收工) 

See you tomorrow, sir. 

But, yes, a lot of firsts. First national story, first front-page byline(标题下署名之行), first TV interview. I would wave to my mom, but the cameraman said not to shift in my seat. 

What a roller coaster.(真是风云突变) 

It really is too bad. Kern was a good man. 

And now Catherine Durant. 

Yes. Right place, right time, I suppose(推断，料想). 

We like her, don’t we? 

Very much. 

Question is, does she like San Corp as much as we like her? 

I would say that that is a very good bet. But then again, I’m not a betting man.

No. You always like a sure thing. 

When it avails(利用，有益于) itself. Good night, Remy. 

Good night, Frank. See you around.(后会有期) 

Hopefully less and less now. 

[Beeping] Oh, no. I charged the wrong thing. What did you have again? 

A medium decaf(无咖啡因咖啡；) latte.  

Med lat, dec. 

[Beeping] [Mutters] I don’t know how to get it to go back. 

This one and this one. 

This one? 

No. Let me do it.  

[Mutters] [Bell dings] I have to ask you to stay back, congressman. 

What’s going on?  

Some guy was trying to get into the building. When we said no, he started tearing(撕碎，撕裂) his clothes off. 

Nobody can hear you. Nobody cares about you. Nothing will come of this. Why don’t you let these nice gentlemen take you home? 

[Radio chatter continues] Cover him up. It’s cold out here. 

[Officer] You heard the congressman. Cover him up. 

Francis?

### Chapter 3

Section 7 has to do with the evaluative(可估价的) measures(措施，办法).

Evaluative measures.

What we're talking about here are performance standards. plain and simple. We can't have that. We open that can of worms(蠕虫；（某些昆虫的）幼虫；寄生虫)

Gotta take it out, Frank. 

The administration wants it in. Then we're all wasting out time.

Well, look, I can cut down the frequency of testing, but it's got to be part of the overall.

That's the thin edge of a two-ton wedge.

No way, non-debatable(有争议的，有待商榷的).(没得商量)

All right, hold on. There's no harm in hearing them out, right?

Frank, what do you have in mind?

We adjust article 4. Hand me article 4. We go every three years instread of two.

Frank, for us to even consider testing.

Marty, we can't negotiate(谈判，磋商，洽谈) time intervals here.

If, I'm just saying if.

The frequency could never be more than five years.

Look, five is a little high, but if you can bend on(下定决心做某事；增速；系住) that

Marty, wait wait wait, and it's not just frequency.

Veteran(经验丰富的，老练的) teachers would have to be exempt(被免除……的，获豁免的) if they hava a proven record of excellence(杰出，卓越；<古>优点，美德) with the students.

Oh, excuse me for a moment. Corey, will you take the reins(缰绳；控制，主宰) on this?

Right, so, article 4, in terms of exceptions(免责条款)

I've been saying for years that we should tear(撕碎，撕裂) it down. It's vulgar(粗俗的，庸俗的，不雅的), it's an embarrassment to the county(郡，（美国的）县).

But time and time again, Frank Underwood has fought to keep it standing. If it weren't for him, 
the Peachoid would've been replaced ages ago. And Jessica Masters would still be alive. The congressman needs to answer for this tragedy(悲惨事件，惨剧；悲剧作品).

What exactly happened?

An 17-year-old girl ran off the road texting her boyfriend, and I quote(引用，引述), "Doesn't the Peachoid look like a giant..." And then she lost control of the car.

Jesus.

Orrin's making a big fuss(大惊小怪，紧张不安) in the local press.

And he's pushing the parents to sue(控告，对……提起诉讼) Gaffney.

Sue Gaffney? It's in his own jurisdiction(司法权，审判权；管辖权；管辖区域，管辖范围).
 
It's worth throwing Gaffney under the bus to dray you into the mess(肮脏，杂乱).

He's after my seat agsin. Has he learned absolutely nothing?

It's a full-on smear(污点，污渍；诽谤，诋毁) campaign(活动，运动；战役，战斗), boss. He's out to destory you.(他想毁了你)

With this? It's a peach, for Christ sake.(强调重要或表示恼火）看在上帝分上，天哪（for God's/goodness'/Christ's/heaven's/Pete's etc. sake）)

Let him make a fool out of himself.

No, he will make a fool out of you.

If he spins(快速旋转；（使）急转身) this right,(炒作得当) gets national coverage.

National coverage, it's a joke.

And you will be the butt(笑柄; 枪靶，靶场) of it. We can't afford that right now. Not when you're in the spotlight with the education bill.

This thing has caused me so much damn(该死，见鬼) trouble.

I know.

So who should I call, parents?

Phone call's not going to cut it.You need to go down there.

Can it wait until Monday?

We get on this thing right now, we can contain(包含，容纳；遏制，防止……蔓延；抑制) it.

We wait until Monday, then there's no way to know how much this is going to blow(刮，吹) up on us.

I can't go down to Gaffney. The unions have just..

We postpone(推迟，延缓；把……放在次要地位；把……放在后面)

They're gonna  be livid.

Marty's reasonable, okay? He will explain to them.

And they're just supposed(推断，料想，猜想；假设) to understand and accept that I had to get up from the negotiating table because some two-bit county administrator wants to

I don't want to interrupt you, sir. but this is not just about Orrin. It's about the parents.

Now, you think about the lawsuit(诉讼，诉讼案).

What happens if you have to testify(作证；证明，证实)? Subpoenas(传票), depositions(证言，书面证词). You get dragged into a court(法院，法庭) battle, there is no education bill. We can't ignore this.

I just hate this small-ball crap(胡扯，废话).

It's called the what? The peach what?

The Peachoid, It's a giant(巨人；高大健壮的人) water tower in the shape of peach.

I just googled it. The Peachoid.

She was 17, Linda.

You're right. I'm sorry.

I need another week. 

No, that's not going to work. The president makes his speech on Tuesday. We've already announced.

Speeches can be rescheduled.

We have to show some progress on education, Frank. The first hundred days is almost over. If we push back the speech, it'll look like we're spining(快速旋转；（使）急转身) our wheels.(会让人觉得我们在偷懒)

All right, I'll work something out. Thank you, Linda.

Frank, these are the head of the two largest teachers unions in the country.

I understand.

They flew here on a weekend.

Doug will lead the charge. congressman Phillips is well vetted(仔细检查；彻底审查（某人）).

They flew here to see you, Frank. You're managing this bill.

Put this in the other bag. And I'll be in constant(持续不断的，经常发生的；恒定的，不变的) communication. Anything big comes up. I'm a phone call away.(打电话就行)

It's a 300-page document. We need you in that room.

I would stay if i could. but this is my home district. Now, Marty, cut me a little slack(不紧的，松弛的) here.(放我一马吧) We'll get it done.

You and I go way back. Have I ever let you down?

No, you haven't.

And I don't intend to start now.

It's so nice to finally meet you.

Yeah, I'm a little under the weather.(有点身体不适) I don't want to get you sick.

Well, if you're feeling ill, we can..

No, no, no, I'm fine. It's just a cold.

Well, thank you for coming in.

Of course.

Shall we talk in my office?

These are really cool photographs.

Oh, thank you, Adam Galloway took the pictures.

Have you heard of him?

Yeah.

I met him at the Whitney biennial a couple years ago. and commissioned(委任) him to do these. He just had a big show at ps1.

I'm not up to date on the art world.

That's all right. We're not here to talk about photography, are we? My office is over here.

You run into any trouble, you call me.

I got it covered.(没问题)

Gene Clancy know I'm coming?

Just spoke to him.

Get to it.(那就去吧)

Your flight is booked. leaves in 55 minutes. Ed will be joining you.

Where is steve?

He went home sick about an hour ago, sir. I'll be filling in.(我来顶替他)

What's your name again? Edward what?

Meacham.

You drive fast, Meacham.

You wanted to talk to me?

Come on, Zoe. This is Mrs. Tilden, owner of

She knows who I am.

Mrs. Tilden liked your profile on Catherine Durant.

No, I didn't, I loved it. In depth, uncompromising(不妥协的，不让步的；坚定的). Normally I don't read things before they go to print, but Cathy's a friend. Tell me how you knew she'd be nominated before she did? You want my source?

Tom says you won't tell him.

I haven't told anyone.

Well, I own the paper.

And I'm very grateful(感谢的，感激的) to be working here.

So you're not going to tell me either.

Which do you want, my source or my integrity(正直，诚实；完整，完全；职业操守)?

Tom. Move Zoe's piece to the front of Sunday's edition(版本，版次；一集，一期).

Let me think that over.

You think it over as much as you want. Then put it on the front page.

I've worked really hard to gain(获得，赢得) a foothold with world well. Six years ago it was just me and a macbook.

I understand.

And I had to juggle(力图使平衡，尽力应付) two temp jobs just to pay the rent(租金，租用费).

It's your baby. You don't want to let it go.

Well, I just

And you wouldn't have to, Gillian.

All I want is for you to grow what you've already built.

I heard you fired half your staff.

Yes, I did.

That worries me.

I let them go to make room for you.

I'm just not sure we're the right match. To be honest, I'm a little uncomfortable working with someone who's commissioning famous photographs when I can't even buy my volunteers(志愿者，义务工作者) bus fair to the office.

Do you know who Nicky Hemler is?

No.

Nicky owns one of the biggest galleries in Chelsea. She desperately(绝望地，拼命地，不顾一切地；非常，极其) wanted to represent Adam Galloway. I delivered on Adam. And in return, she contributes almost 40 grand a year to CWI. That money goes to impact(撞击，冲击力；巨大影响，强大作用) studies, lobbying(游说（政治家或政府）) efforts, research. World well could benefit from that sort of money, Gilliam. And we can benefit from your expertise(专长，专门技能（知识）；专家的意见).

Can I think about it?

Of course. We don't have to jump into anything.

I grew up here, in the up country.

Bibles(圣经), barbecues, and broken backs.

Everything gets just a little bit thicker(更厚的，更粗的；更浓密的) this far south. (这么靠南的地方，一切都更加浓郁)

The air, the blood, even me.

I try to make it down here at least once a month.(我尽量每个月过来一次)

Every trip is a reminder of how far I've come.

I hated Gaffney as a kid, when I had nothing.

But now I've come to appreciate(欣赏，鉴赏) it.

It's not as suffocating(（使）窒息而死，（使）闷死) as it once was, except when I have to deal with the sort of nonsense(荒谬的想法（看法），胡说；愚蠢的行为，胡闹) that makes me want to hang(悬挂，吊) myself.

Trun left on route one.

Don't listen to her. I know a better way.

Yes, sir.

We don't have the money, Frank.

The legal bills alone will kill us.(单是诉讼费就够我们受的)

How about a settlement(协议，和解；定居点，聚居地)?

I'll look at the numbers.

What's it look like to you?(你说它像什么？)

Like a peach.

No, I mean what does it really look like?

As mayor, I stick(粘，贴；铭记在心，经久不忘) with a peach.(我还认定像桃子) As a private citizen, well, it looks like the sun is shinning where it shouldn't be.

There's a better way to handle this.

Really, Frank? And what's that?

I'm not trying to start an argument here.

You make it sound like I'm in the wrong.

No, you know exactly what you're doing, Orrin. You're using this poor girl's death for your own political advantage.

You're the one that fought me when the peach farmers bitched(发牢骚；<非正式>诽谤，口出恶言) and moaned(呻吟，呜咽) about me tearing(撕碎，撕裂) it down.

You're the one that took their money.

It's a water tower.

It's ungodly(邪恶的；不敬畏神的；荒唐的).

Orrin.

This is cut and dry(这是老生常谈), Frank. I fought to tear it down. You fought to keep up. That girl's blood is on your hands, and I'm taking you to task for it.(我要你为之负责)

All right. I'll tell you what. Dick Peters is going to retire this term. That means there's an open race in the fourth district. How about I help you lock up that seat?

I'm not looking to make a deal, Frank.

It's not a deal. It's an opportunity.

I'll be just fine.(算了吧)

You may despise(鄙视，厌恶，看不起) me, Orrin. But the classy(优等的；上等的；漂亮的) thing to do would've been to invite us up for some of that iced tea.

What are you doing? You shouldn't run here. It's disgraceful(不名誉的，可耻的). Have you no respect(尊敬，敬重；重视)?

The criteria(（评判或做决定的）标准，准则，尺度 ) is a starting point. They're suggested, no mandated(强制执行，颁布). We assemble(（使）集合，（使）聚集；装配，组装) a council(委员会，理事会) of experts who will determine exactly

Nowwhere here does it say who these experts are. How they'll be chosen.

The president selects the council.

What sort of oversight(监督；失察，疏忽)?

We'd like input on the selection.

Doug, check with Linda.

Calling her now.

Okay, so now can we talk about charter(特许状，许可证) schools?

Charter schools are a no-go.

They have to be in there. You keep them in, we walk.(我们走，不谈了)

The same goes fo us.

Let's not jump to ultimatums(最后通牒；最后结论；基本原理).

Well, let's figure out a way to reduce non-public spending.

All right, give me a few minutes to think about that.

We can't move forward without addressing(处理，设法解决) this point.

I understand, but this is the cornerstone(基石，支柱，基础；隅石，墙角石) of the bill.

Let's talk it out.(那就谈谈吧)

Give me five minutes, Marty, I'll call you right back.

No, no.

If we consider settlement(协议，和解) as an option, we need to be able to pay for it. But if we offer a settlement, aren't we saying

That's my point. We're admitting that the town's responsible for this kid's death.

I say make the peach farmers cough it up.(让桃农付钱)

oh, man, talk about a shit storm.

Y'all mind catchin' me up? (麻烦说说谈到哪了)

Wayne and Travis want to go to court. I don't think that's a good idea.

We can't be pouring(倾倒，倒出) money into a settlement. when we can barely(勉强才能；几乎不，几乎没有) afford to run the city.

What do you think, Gene?

I think that we gotta worry about the peach farmers association.

If there is a hint(暗示，提示) that we're blaming(责怪，归咎于) the Peachoid. they're going to raise holy(<非正式>（表示惊讶、恐慌等）天啊，上帝啊) hell.(他们会闹的不可开交)

who gives a crap(胡扯，废话; 粪便，屎). they gotta suck(将……卷入，吞没) it up.

Let him talk.

I'm just saying that we need to keep them in mind.

She was breaking the law. End of story.(事情就是这样) You can't text while you drive.

yeah, but all a jury's(陪审团；（竞赛的）裁判委员会) going to see is a beautiful 12-year-old girl who's now dead.

No offense, Frank, but you just got here. We've been dealing with this for the last week now.

And where's your solution?

What? You think you know better than us?

I'm just trying to be realistic(务实的，实事求是的；实际的).

Frank, I know you want to swoop(俯冲；突然袭击) down and save the day.(我知道你想从天而降，挽救大局) but there's a principle at stake(在危险中危如累卵利害攸关在危急关头) here. We allow ourselves to be extorted(敲诈；侵占；强求) beacuse of this teenager

When Orrin gets a jury to weep(哭泣，落泪) a river of snot(鼻涕（不礼貌用语）) over this dead girl. when Gaffney goes tits up beacuse you can't afford to pay a seven-figure award(奖，奖品；（收入的）增加) in damages(损害赔偿（damage 的复数）；伤害). when you all get booted(猛踢；锁住（非法停车的轮子）；启动（电脑）) out of office and I lose to Chase, then you can chew(咀嚼，嚼碎) my ear off about principle, beacuse we'll have nothing but time on our hands. Until then, you either contribute, or you keep it shut, Travis. 

Now here's what we're going to do. Gene, how much can we pull together for a settlement if we had to? 

About 150.

That'll work. Jamie, get your boys down to the hardware store to build two billboards(广告牌；布告板). Put them out a mile out on either side of the tower. Have them read, 'Drive safely. No texting behind the wheel.'

Got it.

And get those up by tomorrow morning.

I'll issue(发表，颁布) the permits(执照，许可证).

And let's stop lighting the thing at night.

The peach farmers aren't going to like that.

Well, how much does the electric cost?

4,100 plus change per month.(每个月超过4100) About 50,000 a year.


Jesus, you could put a kid through college on. Let's use that money to start a scholarship fund in her name. Meantime, you tell the association, if they want it lit(点亮，照亮；点燃，点火；偶然发现，获得（light的过去式和过去分词）) up, they can pay for it.

I'll deliver that message happily.

And do me up a budget and a plan for removing the sphincter(肛门括约肌)

The what?

He means the emergency(突发事件，紧急情况) value.(他是指应急阀)

That's interesting. I always thought of it as a clitoris(阴蒂；阴核).

But it's on bottom. I believe the clitoris is above the

But if you imagine a woman on her belly

Enough, I want it done. And Gene, give me everything you've got on road regulations(规章制度，规则). County statutes(法令，法规), not municipal(城市的，市政的). And do you remember that power line business we pulled up at the last election?

Sure do.

Let's make sure we're rock solid on that.(确保那事万无一失)

Does this very expensive dinner. at least buy me an evening of mind-blowing(使兴奋的；引起幻觉的) sexual congress?

It was good, but I do't know if it was that good.(还不错，但也没那么好吧)

Fellatio(吮吸阴茎；口交) good?

Hand job maybe, No promises.

Deal.

Peter, there's something I need to tell you. I have been thinking lately. You know, it might be good to work somewhere else. So I did some interviews, and the speaker's office offered me deputy LD. I just thought it could be good, right. If we're going to have any future to stop this boss-staffer thing and be a real couple.

We are real couple.

I mean not have to hide it like we do at the office.

And it's a great opportunity. The speaker?

Would you hate me if I took the job?

Baby, I want what you want. I'm not, I won't fight you on this, not if this is what you feel you need to do.

Really?

Yeah, and you're right, this is a great opportunity. When do you have to tell them by?

There's no deadline. I don't have to decide right away(立刻).

Okay, well, when you decide, just, you know, help me find a replacement. You know, give me a heads-up(事先警告；（提醒用语）当心；警告信息).

Yeah, of course. I haven't even decided if I'm going to take it. We don't have to talk this through right now. I just, I just thought I'd bring it up.(我只是想我应该提一下)

Should we get out of here?

Yes.

Let's go find the parents. You hang back by the car.(你在这里守着) It's a big crowd, sir. If I get shot or stabbed(刺伤；刺穿) consoling(安慰，慰藉) two grieving parents, I'm a hero from now until the end of time. Let's roll the dice(骰子；掷骰游戏),(我们赌一把) Shall we?

Sir, I can't allow you to go unescorted(没有护卫的；无人陪同的) into all those people.

Allow me? Let's get one thing straight, Meacham. You are never to dictate(命令，规定) what I can and cannot do. The only two words I want to hear from you when I ask you to do something are 'Yes' and 'sir'. Is that understood?

Yes, sir.

Good, Then we're gonna get along just fine.(我们会相处融洽的)

Mr. and Mrs. Masters, I'm Frank Underwood, your congressman. I'm so sorry for your loss. I cannot begin to fathom(深刻理解，彻底弄清)

You're right, You can't, You have no idea.(你完全无法体会)

Forgive me.(请原谅) I don't mean to intrude(闯入；打扰，侵扰), I just

Well, You are intruding.

Dean, please.

What? It's his fault, Isn't it?

Anyway, I just wanted to express my condolences(吊唁，哀悼). and say if there's anything the two of you need

Dean, you don't want to be talking to him. We got legal action pending.

Look, I know what Mr. Chase has been saying, and believe

Nobody invited you, Nobody wants your condolences or your excuses.

Frank, please. You shouldn't have to put up with this right now.

I'm sorry.

Well, that went well.

Hang on a second.(等一下)

Reverend(教士，牧师).

Congressman.

Nice to see you again. I wish it was under better circumstances(条件，情况，环境).

Terrible, isn't it?

It's just terrible. This is so thoughtful(费心的) what you've organizated here.

Least we can do.

Tell me, are the Masters in your congregation(教堂会众；一群，聚集的人（或物）)?

They are, they come every Sunday.

Do you think they'll be at the service tomorrow?

I'll be surprised if they weren't.

I'm wondering can you do me a favor(帮助；提拔?

Anything for you, Frank.

oh, the blue toothbrush is yours, right?

yeah, the blue one.

Peter, where do you keep the light bulbs(电灯泡)? The lamp in the bedroom is out.

In the kitchen, under the sink(水槽，水池).

Here's what I think. I wish I could be bigger(大度) than this, but I can't. and I'm being selfish(自私的，利己的). and I realize it's mostly about me, but fuck it. I have to say it. please don't take that other job, Christina. Anyway, that's how I feel.

I'm glad you told me.

Charters jeopardize(危及，损害) our ability to organize. Which is reason enough. but the bigger issue is that measuring their success

Charters schools have operated under the same evaluative standards that every

Apples and oranges. No matter you look at it, you can't use the same standards to compare.

What, you're advocating(拥护，提倡) a more demanding(费时费力的；苛刻的) criteria(标准，准则，尺度) for charter schools than other scholls

Our point is simple, Frank. Serveral funds should only go to public union school districts

Hold on a second.

Yeah, but we've already increased non-charter funding(专款，拨款) by 10%. The amount going to charter schools is negligible(微不足道的，不值一提的).

It's the precedent(先例，前例), Frank, not the number.

We're setting a lot of precedents, Marty. That's the nature of reform.

Well, some of them we can stomach(忍受，承受), some of them we can't.

All right, let's not get bogged(使……陷于泥淖；陷于泥淖) down in abstractions(抽象；提取；抽象概念；空想). Let's deal with specifics.

Corey, can you walk us through it?(带我们从头理一遍吧)

There's a three-prong(三分法) approach(方法，态度) to determining the amount of funding...

Miss me?

Maybe. A little.

What's it been, 15 hours?

Not even long enough to notice you're gone.

Tell that to Marty Spinella.

How's it coming?

It's coming, slowly, painfully.

Hey, have we always had tulips(郁金香) in the front yard. or am I slowly going insane(疯癫的，精神失常的；蠢极的，荒唐的)?

I planted them last fall.

You did not.

When I was down with you for the campain.

You've never gradened a day in your life. 

Not ture. I have gardened exactly one day in my life.

You were down in Spartanburg doing some sort of fundraiser(资金筹集人；资金筹集活动).

Gene's wife came over with a bucket of bulbs(电灯泡；（植物的）鳞茎，球茎；球状物). and next thing you knew, I was down on my kness in the dirt(污物，尘土；泥土，松土；丑闻，流言蜚语), earthworms(蚯蚓) and all.

I can't even picture it.

Neither can I, and I was there.

What else?(还有什么) Distract(使分心，使转移注意力) me from giant(巨大的，伟大的) peaches and dead teenagers.

What else? oh, I went for a run today, and the strangest, I don't know, that woman 

That's interesting.

What is?

Oh, a text just came. Zoe Barnes.

Who?

Oh, that reporter from the herald you met on night.

Oh, her, I remember. Year, go if you need to call her back.

No, she can wait. I'm talking to my wife.

That's ok, I'm going to bed soon anyway. See you tomorrow?

I hope so, Wish me luck.

Mm, bonsoir(（法）晚安；晚上好), my petite(（女子）娇小的；（妇女服装）小号的) peachoid.

Disgusting(令人反感的，令人恶心的；令人吃惊的，让人无法接受的).

Yeah, all right. that's fine, Corey, Marty?

Frank, let me explain it to you, here's our problem.

What's next on the plate(盘子，碟子)? Feed me.

S Carolina.(南卡罗莱纳州) District Business.(选区事物)

Not now, in the middle of something.

What could possibly be more pressing(紧迫的，迫切的) than me?

You're unstoppable.

Unstoppable, You haven't seen me start yet.

I can't even imagine(想像，设想；料想).

I bet you can.

I bet you have.

Watch Starting point tmrrw(tomorrow的缩写). I'll blow you a kiss.

Frank, did we lose you?

yeah, I'm here, Marty. look, we can talk ourselves in circles about charter schools, but here's what I propose(提议，打算，建议).

In your profile, you go into great detail about the sexism(性别歧视，性别偏见) Durant faced early on in her career.

That's right. When she was first elected. it was still an old boy's club in the senate. 

Journalism used to be that way, too, not so long ago.

I feel really lucky. I've had lost of trailblazers(开拓者；开路的人；先驱者) come before me. For instance, my colleague Janine Skorsky, was the first woman at the herald, to become chief political correspondent, and that was only five years ago.

Has it been those trailblazers who've allowed you to rise so quickly? You've moved up from the metro(大都会的，大城市的) pages to the front page Sunday edition.

Uh, well, I don't konw that, that would be possible if Janine hadn't already paved(为……铺平道路，创造条件) the way.

So does that mean that the herald is not particularly progressive(进步的，先进的)?

I think that they are, Tom is very open minded. He's the reason Janine got promoted(促进；宣传；促销；提升；将（体育运动队）晋级).

That's Tom Hammerschmidt, the executive editor.

Yes, we actually call him the hammer.

The hammer, why?

beacuse he's tough(严厉).

How tough?

He's, uh, Tom has very high standards. I love him. He's a great mentor(导师，指导者). uh, it can be frustrating(令人懊恼的，令人沮丧的) at times. he makes you double and triple check things, and you want to get the news out the moment you have it, and he makes you rewrite until it's perfect. but that's what makes the Herald the Herald.

Is that a workable model in the Internet age?

Our readers think it is.

Well, you have a declining(下降，衰退) readership.

But I don't lay that at Tom's feet.(我不认为这是tom的责任) I think that that's the times we live in, right?

Should newspapers adapt to the times we live in?

It's not that the Herald refuses to adapt. We have an online presence.

Is that maybe not adapting fast enough?

I wouldn't argue with that statement. We could do more.

We've got a special guest with us today. He asked for the opportunity to share a few words with us this morning. Our very own congressman, Frank Underwood.

Thank you, Reverend(教士，牧师). and thanks to that choir(唱诗班，合唱团) for that beautiful hymn(赞美诗；圣歌；欢乐的歌). I want to read, this morning, from... 

NO, you know what no one wants to talk about, Hate. I know all about hate. It starts in your gut(肠，肠道；内脏), deep down here, where it stirs(搅拌，搅和（液体等物质）) and churns(搅拌；搅动), and then it rises. Hate rises fast and volcanic(火山的，火山引发的;（感情或情绪）猛烈的，易突然发作的). It erupts(喷发；爆发，突然发生) hot on the breath. Your eyes go wide and fire. Your clench(攥紧（拳头等），咬紧（牙齿等）) your teeth so hard, you think they'll shatter(使）破碎，碎裂；破坏). 

I hate you, God, I hate you. Oh, don't tell me you haven't said those words before. I know you have. we all have. If you've ever felt so crushing(使心烦意乱，使消沉) a loss(沉痛的打击).

There are two parents with us today. who know that pain, the most terrible hurt of all, losing a child before her time. If Dean and Leanne were to stand up right now and scream those awful words of hate, could we blame them? I couldn't. At least, their hatred(仇恨，憎恨，敌意) I can understand. I can grasp(理解（力），领会) it. but God's wantonness(繁茂；嬉戏；放纵), his cruelty(残酷，残忍；不公，虐待), I can't even begin to... 

My father dropped dead of a heart attack at the age of 43, and when he died, I looked up to God, and I said those words, because my father was so young, so full of life, so full of dreams. Why would God take him from us?

Truth be told I never really knew him. or what his dreams were. He was quiet, timid(羞怯的，胆小的), almost invisible(看不见的，隐形的). My mother didn't think much of him. My mother's mother hated him. The man never scratched(挠（痒处）；划破（皮肤）；刮去痕迹) the surface(表面；水面，地面；桌面) of life.(他根本没有真正的活过), maybe it's best he died so young. He wasn't doing much but taking up space. But that doesn't make for a very powerful eulogy(悼词；颂词；颂扬；赞词), now, does it?

I wept(哭泣), I screamed, why God? How can I not hate you? when you steal form me the person I most love and admire in this world? I don't understand it and I hate you for it.

The Bible says in proverbs(谚语，格言；典型，模范), 'Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean(倚靠，靠在) not your own understanding' God is telling us to trust him, to love him despite(尽管，即使) our own ignnorance(无知，愚昧). After all, what is faith. if it doesn't endure(持续存在，持久；忍受，忍耐) when we are tested the most? we will never understand why God took Jesscia or my father or anyone. And while God may not give us answers, he has given us the capacity for love. Our job is to love him, without questioning his plan. So I pray(祈祷，祷告；渴望，祈望) to you, dear Lord. I pray to you to help strengthen our love for you and to embrace(拥抱；欣然接受，乐意采纳) Dean and Leanne with the warmth of your love in return. and I pray that you will help us fend(避开，挡开；回避) off hatred. So that we may all truly trust in you with all our hearts, and lean not on our own understanding. Amen.

Your job is to report the news, not be the news. 

I was promoting(促进；提升；推销) the paper.

You were promoting Zoe Barnes.

Is this about how I said we called you the hammer? Because if that upset you, I apologize.

You're missing the point.

I don't want you talking about anything that happens here, not nicknames, not how progressive we are, not whether we are adapting to the Internet. Any thoughts you have about this paper, you keep them to yourself, or you bring them to me. You don't get on national television and sp

I'm sorry I wasn't trying to

Don't interrupt when I'm talking.

You can speak to me like an adult, Tom. You don't have to lecture(讲座，讲课，演讲；训斥，告诫) me like a little girl.

You haven't eraned the right to be treated as an adult. You think a few front-page stories and some face time on TV makes you the next Judy Miller? You've got a long way to go. Don't be so arrogant(傲慢的，自大的).

Okay, so you think when a woman asks to be treated with respect that's arrogant?

Are you accusing(控告，指控；指责) me of sexism?

Just making an observation?

No TV for a month.

What?

You heard me. No interviews.

That't completely unfair.

You want to make it no TV indefinitely(无限期地，不确定地)? We're done. You can go now.

Hello?

Gillian, it's Claire Underwood, can I come up?

Have you seen a doctor?

Giardia's(贾第虫属；梨形鞭毛虫属) not so bad. It'll pass in another week or so.

You don't have health insurance, do you?

Nope.

I'll make an appointment for you to see my personal GP tomorrow.

Medicine doesn't really do much. You have to let it run its course.

Well, we'll let it run its course under proper(真正的，像样的; 合适的) supervision(监督，管理). I won't take no for an answer on this. I'll drag you to the hosptial myself if I have to. You're going to the doctor, No argument(争论，争吵).

Thanks.

They're about to walk. They won't listen to a word I say.

Buth unions? Put Marty on the phone.

Hang on, Marty.

Yeah, It's Frank?

This isn't working, Frank.

Marty, you have got to keep them in that room.

They lost their patience. They're upset you're on in the room, Frank.

I'll be back this afternoon.

No, it's too late.

Look, tell them I'll come down on subsidies(补助金，补贴，津贴) for charter schools.

Even so, they're angry about the performance standards. we're not even halfway through this thing. They're so much in it that they...

Tell them that I'll roll voer on performance standards, five-year intervals.

It should be you telling them that, Frank. you here, at this table.

I konw that. I'm doing the best I can. but I can't be in two places at once. Now look, I promise you, if you keep them in that room, we will get together this hump(小圆丘，岗，隆起；驼峰；（人的）驼背；恼怒，烦恼) as soon as I get back. Marty, you are their lobbyists. You know what's best for them. Save them from themselves.(别让他们作茧自缚)

okay, I'll see what I can do.

September.

Do not let Spinella out of your sight. and lock the goddamn(该死的；讨厌的；受诅咒的) doors if you have to.

You got it.(没问题)

Here we go.

I know you're a busy man. I hope we're not keeping you.

no, no, no, I've got all the time in the world. This is ham(火腿；蹩脚演员) and these are turkey. And there's some potato salad.

Shall we have a prayer? Gracious(有礼貌的，和蔼的;（上帝）慈悲的；尊贵的) loving God...

Have you had this before?

This is the third time. I'm used to it by now. Well, I'm not used to it, but it beats malaria(疟疾).

You've had malaria.

In Zimbabwe(津巴布韦). That took me out for a month.

You make a lot of sacrifices(牺牲，损失；献身，供奉).

I don't see it as a sacrifices. 

You turned down a six-figure salary at Google to start your own non-profit. People don't get malaria in Palo Alto.

You do your research.(你做了功课啊)

when it's someone I care about.

Claire, I turned down that job. because I would've hated myself. It was a lot of money, but for what? So they could fulfill their diversity(多样性，多样化；不同，差异) quota(定额，限额) with an Asian girl peddling(挨户销售，巡回销售；贩卖) a Stanford degree?

Not just any Asian girl. A valedictorian(毕业典礼上）致告别辞的最优秀毕业生).

Let me offer you what Google couldn't. I know what it is. to be capable and beautiful and ambitious. and be on people like Sergey and Larry's checklist of things that look good to have on a shelf. I'm not trying to acquisition(金钱、财物等的）获取；购买，添置) you. What I see in you is a woman I admire, which doesn't happen often. I want to enable(使能够，使可能；激活，启动；准许，授权) you. I want to clear the way for you so that you can achieve what you want to achieve, on your own terms. thanks for the tea. And I'll send a car to pick you up for the doctor tomorrow. when you're back on your feet,(等你感觉好一点) do you think maybe we can work something out?

Yes, I think we could.

That's her at junior(<美>（高中或大学的）三年级学生；) prom(<美>（美国高中生在学年末举行的）正式舞会).

beautiful.

Here she is in her letter jacket. she made varsity(大学；大学运动代表队) as a freshman. I remember the day she found out. Coach called. Jessie starts jumping up and down. 'Mom, guess what?' I'm sorry.

Don't be, it's fine.

Why are we doing this?

Honestly, what's to be gained(获得，得到) in dredging(疏浚；挖掘) up all this stuff?

Remembering the good things helps sometimes

Not when it puts my wife in tears. I appreciate what you said at the church, but it doesn't do us any good. Neither does this.

Well, what can I do to help?

You can't do anything. She's gone.

You're right. I can't change that. But I can't make sure that the city offers you a sizable settlement.

You mean buy us off?

No, I mean help you. avoiding years of court battles. Jessica was going to go to Furman. Is that right? On a volleyball(排球) scholarship?

Yes, a full ride.(全额奖学金)

Well, I spoke to the president of the university this morning. and we'd like to create a new scholarship in your daughter's name. If you'd like that. It's entirely up to you. but most important, we have to make sure that this never happens again. we've got safety billboards going up. we're going to stop lighting the tower at night. and we're putting the guard rails(用栏杆把……围起) in.

Should've done all that before she ran off the road.

Would you like me to resign(辞（职），放弃), Mr. Masters? Just say the word, and it's done. If it will bring you any satisfaction(满意，称心). I asked the reverend once. what are we supposed to do in the face of so much senseless(愚蠢的；无知觉的；无意识的) pain? And he said to me, what else can we do, but take what seems meaningless and try to make something meaningful from it.

He's right. That's how God works through us. Will you let me work for you?

What you have to underground about my people is that they are a noble(崇高的，高尚的) people. humility(谦逊，谦恭) is their form of pride(自豪（感）；自尊（心）). It is their strengthen, it is their weakness. and if you can humble(谦虚的，谦卑的) yourself before them. they will do anything you ask.

Tell us more about the scholarship.

What are you doing?

working.

on what?

the, uh, BRAC commission(考察团，委员会) stuff. I'm behind on it.

It's Sunday.

So?

You don't usually work on the weekend.

Well, now I do.

There's, uh, coffee in the kitchen. You want some?

Peter? If I decide to stay, it's because it's what I want, not what you want.

I understand.

Which draft are you reading of the written testimony(证词，证言；证据)?

The one you sent on Thursday?

I actually changed it on Friday.

Can I show you? Yeah, I was thinking that we could start with job number. and then go to economics multipilers instead of the other way around. What do you think? 

Let's see what it look like.

Picture this. A 17-year-old girl traveling at 60 miles an hour spins(快速旋转；（使）急转身) out of control in no traffic. She hits a guard rail. But if she's wearing her seatbelt, which she was, and her car doesn't roll over three times down a 20-foot ditch(沟渠，壕沟), which it did, then that young woman is still alive. but you know what? The county administrator didn't build those guard rails, so now she's dead.

We looked up the statute(法令，法规), Guard rails are under county supervision(监督，管理). 

Are you trying to turn this around on me?

That's not all, Orrin. Your easement(地役权；缓和；减轻). You see, every couple of years the piedmont(山麓；山麓地带) electric, they apply to bring power lines through Gaffney. The route comes right through you lot. Now, Gene and I always fight them off. But this year, if they were to reapply, hmm 

Eminent(卓越的，出众的；突出的，明显的) domain(领域，范围；领土). It would be such a shame(羞耻，羞愧；羞耻心 ) to have to tear down this beautiful home.

Fuch you, Frank. You can't just roll(翻滚，滚动) up on my property(所有物，财产；地产，房地产) and act like you own it.

Oh, but I can, we just did. I've won this district 11 times. Do you think that's just luck and a firm(坚定地，坚决地) handshake? But I'll tell you what, I'm not a vindictive(怀恨的；有报仇心的；惩罚的) person. I don't like for anybody to lose if everybody can win. So I'm going to help you get elected in the fourth. You get to keep you house. I keep the fifth. We put the peachoid behind us, and everybody's happy. what do you say?

Well, that's all right. You think about it. I'm sure you'll do the right thing. Oh, and I'm looking forward to having you in congress, Orrin. It's always good to have friends on the other side of the aisle(走廊，过道；（教堂）耳堂，侧堂).

I've been offered a spot on Nightline. 

You want my advice.

I don't want it. I need it.

Close your eyes. So 11:25, Nightline is about to come on. Millions of people are watching. Where are you, home? At the studio? And what do you see? I see lights. I see a camera. and that little red dot goes on. Tell me what you hear?

I hear my voice.

and those millions of people, what do they hear?

My voice.

and what do they see?

my face.

so you don't need my advice.

Hammerschmidt's going to freak(吃惊，不安，恼怒).

You don't want to work anywhere you're not willing to get fired from, Zoe. Treading(踩，踏，践踏；踩碎，踩烂) water's the same as drowning(淹没于；（使）淹死) for people like you and me.

Good luck, I'll be watching.

Hey, wait, when do you get back?

When I get back, you'll know.

Hello, Nancy.

Welcome back, sir. Linda Vasquez called for you.

Tell her I'll call her in a couple hours with an update.

Sir? Unless(除非) you need anything(如果不需要别的), Kyle has you covered.

No, go home. You did well this weekend. oh, and before you go home, can you do me a favor? Would you swing(摆动，摇荡) by my home, and make sure these get to Claire?

Yes, sir. and thank you, sir, for being so patient.

### character 4

It's there for leverage(影响力，手段；杠杆力，杠杆作用) so that we can lock down performances standards. You don't toss(扔，抛，掷) around their right to collective bargaining(讨价还价；交易；交涉) like a poker(拨火棍；纸牌戏) chip(炸薯条，炸薯片；芯片).

If we don't, they won't budge(发芽，长出花蕾；为……进行芽接).

Has Marty Spinella seen this?

Not the version I showed him.

So you lied to his face.

No, I revised(改变，修正) the parameters of my promise.

which is lying.

which is politics. the sort you're well versed(<古>作诗) in, Bob.

Here's some politics for you. I allow this to go to the floor. I get murdered(谋杀，凶杀) next election.

This is coming from the president.

Last time I checked, I was still a Democrat, frank, and you were too. Are you telling me the president isn't? Because he's acting a hell(地狱；苦难的经历；（有人认为含冒犯意）该死，见鬼) of a lot like a Republican.

I thought Bob was on our team. 

Just sit him down with the president ten minutes. 

We won't touch collective bargaining.

Are you interested in my advice on this, or do you just want me to deliver the message?

I'm always interested in your advice, Frank.

Birch is right, you're going to burn a lot of bridges. The precedent should at least sit down with him. and let him make his case.

You tell Bob, I'm happy to schedule a meeting with the president once he's set a date to put this bill on the floor.

The president can fuck himself.

This is the platform. It's what he ran on.

I don't give a shit what he ran on. He can't steamroll(用压路机碾，粉碎；压倒) the house. And don't forget you work for me, Frank, not him. If he wants something on the floor, he's gonna have to talk to me directly.

I know you take a lot of pride in your manhood(<文>阴茎), Bob, and it's impressive(给人印象深刻的，令人钦佩的). but as big as it is, Linda can still shut the door on it.

Tell Vasquez the bill is dead.

That's not the first time he's pulled that stunt(特技表演；噱头，作秀) on me. probably should have held my tongue. but I just couldn't resist(阻挡，抵制；抵抗，回击) the chance to see him shrivel(枯萎；皱缩).

Let's strike the anti-collective bargaining provision(提供，供应；准备，预备) from the bill.

Linda and I have talked it over, and I think she's right on this. Tell Bob he can come by tomorrow afternoon.

Sir, respectfully(尊敬地),I do not think you should give him the satisfaction(满意，称心). 

Well, give me a reason.

Makes us appear weak. There's a opportunity for you to establish your supremacy(霸权，至高无上；优势). we should seize(抓住，捉住；) it.

But without Birch's cooperation, we're fighting an uphill(上坡的，向上的) before we even get the bill to the floor, Frank, we discussed this.

Sir, if you give in now, Birch will walk all over you for the next four years. I can get this bill on the house floor as is. I promise you.

All right, Frank. show me what you can do.

Thank you, Mr. president.

That was her trying to take credit for my idea. Advice she wouldn't take from me.. unacceptable. I will not allow her to sell my goods when she cuts me out of the profits.

I specifically told her no interviews. she disobeyed me... not just once, At least eight times in the past month.

she stays, Tom. 

she has no repect for my authority, Margaret.

I said she stays.

There are rules. there's a way of doing things. If I have a reporter who won't listen to...

two freshman girls are moving into their dorm(宿舍) room together. one of them's from Georgia, one of them's from Connecticut. the girl from Connecticut's helping her mother put up curtains(窗帘，门帘). the girl from Georgia truns to them and says, 'Hi, where y'll from? the girl from Connecticut says, 'we're from a place where we know not to end a sentence with a preposition(介词，前置词)', the girl from Georgia says, 'oh, beg my pardon. where y'll from? cunt(<俚>阴道，女性阴部；<俚>讨厌鬼，恶人)?'. You heard that ont before?
 
A version of it, with softer language.

Tom, we don't need people who follow the rules. we need people with personality. we want Zoe's face, her energy, we want to get her on TV as mush as possible. It help us cut though the noise. see what I'm saying?

I hear you, Margaret.

Thank you, Tom.

oh, I, uh, thought. I wanted to say hi to Evelyn. This was her office. I don't think she works here anymore. Gillian Core, I came on board a couple of weeks ago.

Gillian, world well.

yeah

I've heard great things. Remy Danton.

You work with Claire?

In a way.

Hello, Remy.

I see you've met Gillian.

Yes, just now.

She's doing fantastic work for us, as you could see.

Red is completed wells, green, uh, potential(潜在的，可能的) sites, yellow, approved sites. and blue are the filtration centers.

Nice, so you liking it here?

yeah, my staff and I are loving it. Claire's opened a lot of doors for us.

sounds like Claire.

Shall we head to my office?

Gillian, nice to meet you.

nice to meet you.

what happened?

things got complicated(使复杂化，使难以理解). San Corp was in a difficult situation.

I would have thought you'd setp up, when things were difficult, not hold the donation hostage(人质).

well, things are less complicated now. the donation is back on the table.

I had to fire half my staff.

now you can hire them back. San Corp is prepared to double its initial commitment(责任；花费，使用（资金、时间、人力）；需要定期支付的款项). 1.5 million, lump sum, this quarter.

why? 

public relations. same as before.

and what do they want from Francis?

Things are square with Frank. we're only talking about the CWI

but why double it?

Because I said they should. the more they give, the more you can do. the more you can do, the better they look. and that's why they hired Glendon Hill to make them look good.

and they also hired you to get traction(拖，拉，牵引，拉力，牵引力) in congress.

not in this case.(这次不同) we want a long-term partnership, Claire. This is a investment(投资) in the future. we're not attaching string.(我们没有其他要求)

I'll think about it.

they'd really love to move quickly on this.

I said I'll think about it.

Madeleine, you have to email me this shit. I need it in writing. and with more than an hour's notice.

yeah, I know that, but you have to understand we, we have a plan. we have a way that we do this, and when you...

okay, fine. yeah, yeah, bye.

Medeleine has decided to have a spur-of-the-moment(立刻的一时冲动的即兴的心血来潮) trip to Orlando with her lastest eHarmony catch. No heads-up(不事前通知), no warning,

The kids?

They get out of school at 2:30.

I can do the shipbuilders meeting.

You sure?

yeah, it's just a public affairs(公共事务，政治事务) team, I'll brief(给……指示，向……介绍情况) you and then you can call them tomorrow.

Go get your kids.

Remy came by this morning, to the office.

what does he want?

The donation's back on the table. They've doubled it to 1.5 million.

you said no, right?

I didn't. he doesn't want anything from you, Francis.

come on, Claire, you know better than that.

I specifically(特意，专门地) asked.

Maybe not right now. but look, I invented(发明，创造；编造，虚构) this guy, all right? it's a slippery(湿滑的，容易打滑的) slope(斜坡，斜面；山坡), you...

think of what I can do with this money. I can hire back people I let go. I can help accelerate(使加快，促进；（车辆或驾驶者）加速) the funding for the projects that Gillian has brought in.

Let's find another way to raise the money.

But it's right there at my feet.

Claire, I have too much on my plate right now. I can't have San corp breathing down my neck again. I can't have Remy... look, it's Remy. He knows me too well, It's dangerous. look at the bigger picture here. I'm asking.

No, you're not.

Claire.

I'll tell you what I told him.

which was?

I'll think about it.

I know there's been some tension(紧张，焦虑；紧张关系), and I'm probably more to blame(责备，过错，罪责) than you are. But I'd like to put that behind us. Zoe, you're going to be our new White House correspondent.

what about Jannie?

I promoted(促进，提倡；升职) her to Midwest Bureau chief.

She's okay with that? she wants to give up the White House?

It the decision I've made.

It's just that Jannie has so much experience. I thought you'd be more excited about this.

I'm sorry, I just thought you brought me in here to... I don't know.

To fire you.

Maybe.

What under the bridge. we're starting over.(我们要重新开始)

so are you ready to take this on?

Can I think about it?

People usually don't have to think about it when they're offered the White House, Zoe.

Just a day or two.

Jannie is booked for a flight to Chicago on Friday.

I'll let you know before then. I just need to 

Thank you, thank you, Tom.

David Rasmussen is the majority leader, which means he's one step above me, and one below Birch. Which is akin(相似的，类似的；有血缘关系的) to being between a very hungry wolf and a very quarrelsome(爱争吵的，好口角的) sheep. Let's see if he stays with the herd(羊群) or joins the pack.

David, you mind if I join you?

Please, A salad, huh?

yes, I'm trying to take better care of myself.

Good man, Diet(节食)?

Diet, exercise, everything. You ought to take better care of yourself too.

Well, they should stop serving such good pizza.

Oh, I'm not talking about the food. I'm talking about Birch. You are never going to be speaker unless you do something about it.

I'm very satisfied(使满意，使满足；满足（要求、需要等）) where I am.

oh, come on.

For the time being, yeah.

Time being never, The only way you beacome speaker is if Birch loses his district or retires, neither of which is going to happen before you and I have dentures(齿列，托牙；一副假牙).

I'm not happy where this conversation is going, Frank.

If you want it, and I know you do, there's a way.

Okay, right, I can't...

all you need is a simple majority... 218 votes. we're going to get at least 205 out of the GOP. and after that, all you need is 13 Democrats. You and I make two.

Are you out of your mind?

Just consider it for a moment?

You want to collude(勾结；串通；共谋) with the Republicans?

I don't want to, but I would if you become speaker in the process.

Never been done before.

There's a first time for everything.

This is ridiculous(可笑的，荒谬的).

The Republicans would love a chance to knock Bob down a peg or two.

And you want to help them.

I want to help us. Bob will not play ball with the White House. Now, you're a reasonable man, David, and he's not.

you know what I am? I'm a discreet(谨慎的，周到的；) man. You're lucky for that. I'm not going to mention this to Bob, but if you ever bring it up again. I won't have a choice.

looks like he opted(选择，作出抉择) for the herd

Claire, I'd like to put an order for the water filters and the well-digging equipment(设备，用具) for the South Sudan project. can we talk about the budget?

How much?

200,000

For one project?

I know it's a lot. but it'll be our flagship(旗舰) project in Africa, and we would be the first organization there to work on this scale.

I'd like to go over the specifics(细节；特性) first. I have the budget right here.

Let me just grab(攫取，抓住；（尤指匆忙地）取) my messages, and then I'll come in to you.

Okay, I'll be in my office.

Any calls while I was out?

They're on the desk, and this came by messenger(送信人，邮递员，报信者).

Adam, It's Claire.
 
Yes, I know. It has.

No reason. I was just thinking about you.

You're right, It is a lie. I do have a reason. I need to use you.

The White House is where news goes to die. Everything's canned(罐装的；录音的).(所有的东西都是陈腔滥调) These perfectly prepared statements...

It's a prestigious(有威望的，有声望的) job, Zoe.

Used to be, when I was in ninth grade. Now it's a graveyard(墓地). The only halfway(在中间，在中途；还可以，过得去) interesting thing they do is throw a big dinner party once a year. where they pat(轻拍（以示喜爱、赞同或安慰）) themselves on the black and rub(擦，磨擦) shoulders with movie stars.(跟电影明星勾肩搭背) who need that?

Everyday since you srarted here, you've begged me to move up, and now...

My goal in life is not to climb up the Herald's ladder(梯子；（职位晋升的）阶梯) one rung(梯子的）横档；梯级（尤指社会等级或职业结构）；（椅子的）横档) at a time (一步一步爬) until I've got my own stationery(信纸，信笺；文具).

Some of us value a career at a paper like this.

I'm sorry, I didn't mean for that to come off..

Well, it did, and you skipped a few rungs, by the way.

Do what you want to do, Zoe. but if you want me to be your cheerleader and say, 'yeah, turn it down,' I won't. I would have killed fot that job when I first started here.

Put Fichtner in the 'Leaning(倾斜；倾向于做) yes' Column.

Don't you think he's a neutral(中立的，不偏不倚的)?

He hates Birch.

Yeah, but he owes Birch for the ways and means appointment.

Put him in the 'neutral'. who else?

Ramirez is a neutral?
 
oh, this list is so shaky(颤抖的，颤巍巍的；不牢靠的). Any one of them leaks it to Bob... No, what we need is one name, one person who can deliver 12. 

The black caucus(干部会议；核心会议；党团会议).

Womack.

What can we offer him?

what does he need?

Let me pull up his file. Here we go. McCudden air force base employs 3,000 people in his district. It's on the DOD's chopping(砍，剁；) block this year.

who do we know on the BRAC commission?

That's dangerous. The trail(痕迹，踪迹) leads back to us trying to influence the DOD or the BRAC.

no, no, no, what we do is we close another base. we leave enough money in the DOD's buget.(Department of Defense of the United States) to keep Womack's base off the list. what we need is someone we own.

Dad, I'm hungry.

Coming, buddy(<美，非正式>老兄，兄弟). Here we go. with cheese. without cheese.

um, dad? that looks pretty disgusting.

yes, it looks disgusting.

it's not how it looks, it's how it tastes.

and a fork would be nice.

shit, okay, hole on.(稍等)

Good evening, Mr. Russo. There's a Mr. Underwood here to see you.

uh, okay, send him up.

Hi, there.

Hi.

Hi, I'm Frank. Nice to meet you both.

Do you work with dad?

I do.

Congressman Underwood is daddy's boss.

I thought you didn't have a boss.

Everybody has a boss, sweetheart, even congressman. why don't you take your dinner and got into the bedroom?

But I wanted to watch TV.

Go now.

cute(漂亮的，可爱的) kids.

yeah, I like them.

can I get you a drink?

No, I won't be here long.

yeah, have a seat.

oh, thanks.

Is that a ps vita(罗马数字5)?

which games does he have?

all of them.

I have a console at home. I play sometimes to relax. I ought(应该（表义务、责任、必要等）；应该（表期望）) to get one of these for the car.

So, Peter. we need to close the shipyard(造船厂；船坞；修船厂) in your district. The BRAC hearing is tomorrow. You won't put up your usual fight. You have zero testimony(证词，证言) to add.

I can't do that.

Yes, you can, Peter.

I spent months on that testimony. I lobbied the commission. my entire office...

I'm sure you've done splendid(极佳的，非常好的) work. but unfortunately it can't come to fruition(完成，成就；结果实).

why?

politics.

There's forces bigger than either of us at play here.

12,000 job.

I konw. it's a shame(羞耻，羞愧；羞耻心，羞耻感；令人惋惜的事，让人遗憾的事).

keeping that shipyard open is what got me elected. those people are my friends.

I'm not here to debate(讨论，辩论) this, Peter. the base will close. the only question is, will you make it a swift(迅速的，立刻的；) death or a painful one?

No way, I won't sit on my hands.

I sympathize(同情，体谅；赞同，支持) that this is gonna be difficult for you. and I don't know how yet, but I will make it up to you,(将来我会弥补你的) Peter. I'm a powerful friend to have right now. perhaps your only friend. so don't defy me.

Love of family. most politicians are permanently(永久地；（问题或困难）不断发生地，一直存在地) chained to that slogan 'family values'. but when you cozy(密切的，互相勾结的) up to hookers(妓女；渔船) and I find out, I will make that hypocrisy(虚伪，伪善) hurt.

Did you get the present I sent you?

You wouldn't really call it a present.

Well, more of a gentel reminder, maybe.

Mm, more heavy-handed(严厉的；笨手笨脚的；手辣的) than gentel. which surprised me. It's not really style, Francis. but, yes, I got it.

I like that one.

I do too.

But the first one's better.

You think?

something special tomorrow?

Adam Galloway's coming down from New York.

What for?

Because I need some of his photographs. for the silent auction(拍卖；（桥牌）叫牌阶段) at the gala next month.

You speak to Remy yet?

I haven't.

If you want to look inviting(诱人的，吸引人的), weat the black one.

oh, okay, great, thanks.

how is it the world keeps spining(快速旋转；（使）急转身). and you manage to stay ahead of it?

David's on board with this? 

it was his idea.

Then why isn't he here?

well, we have to be careful until it's a done deal.

I don't know, Frank.

Thinkg about it, Terry.

you could become the first African-American majority leader in the United States congress. let's make some history.

you don't care about history, you just wanted me because I can round up the votes.

I need the votes, and I do care about history. but most importantly, Terry. you know how to lead. you're the head of the black caucus of a reason. so David becomes speaker. I become majority leader...

And I stay on as whip.

why don't you want majority leader for yourself?

I'm satisfied where I am. Maybe one day, when you become speaker, you'll bump(碰上，撞上) me up.(你会提拔我)

This is the sort of thing that there's no turning back.(没有回头路)

I can throw a cherry on top.(锦上添花) McCudden stays open.

How?

You don't want to know how. You just want the headline when you keep 3,000 jobs in your district.

12?

12 votes.

I can get you 10, probably 11.

It's so refreshing to work with someone, who will throw a saddle(鞍，马鞍) on a gift horse.(对到手的礼物不吹毛求疵) rather than look it in the mouth.

That's nice.

I found her in a village outside Amravati. Her name was Tiala. She died three weeks after I took that picture.

oh, that's awful. 

you can have them all if you like. I love your hair short. Do you have plans tonight?

No.

Is Frank expecting(期待；预计；要求) you home?

I'm sure he'll be home late.

Get dinner with me.

What time is your train?

I don't book round-trip tickets.(我没有订返程票)

It's going to be a while before I can leave.

What time will you be done?

probably at 8:00

I'll pick a place. let you konw.

Ah, David,

how are you, Joe?

I'm behind you, let's do this.

Do what?

keep your cards close. I like this.

Hi, yeah, this is room 1214. I'd like a bottle of the Weinbach, please. yeah, actually(实际上，事实上), could you make that two bottles? thank you.

sit down, you're making me nervous.

you still somke?

From time to time(不时有时时常偶尔), yes.

I quit, these are an illusion(错觉，幻觉；幻想，错误的观念). you want?

sure.

what?

not now.

okay.

I should go.

I just... it seemed... I know.

we can't start this again. when i end someting, I end it.

so why'd you have me come all the way down from New York?

It was a mistake. I'm sorry, Adam. I should've kept it business.

Side of you I like the least.(我最不喜欢你这一面) There are no mistakes, Claire.

hello, more wine? how was your day?

good.

Adam well?

He is.

we just had dinner. I e-maild Remy on the way home. I told him I'm not taking the money. 

thank you. I appreciate that, this was not easy.

well, we don't like easy, do we?

oh, the evidence(根据，证明) would suggest it.

Is it all right if the Holburn's come over for dinner Wednesday night? I want Felicity to buy some tables for the gala(盛会，庆典；<英> 体育运动会)?

yeah, of course.

I'm going to need congressman and senators there.

you need to call in favors.

Done.

not a few, a lot.

I'll start making calls in the morning.

Adam donated ten photographs.

That was generous(慷慨的，大方的；大量的，丰富的；宽宏大量的) of him.

He's staying at the Mandarin.

And you?

Here.

But the proving ground's importance stems far beyond it's strategic(战略（性）的， 策略（上）的) geographic(地理的，地理学的) value. APG's research and development of military material is central to our nation's counter-terrorism(反恐) efforts. The base houses research laboratories(实验室) for preventative(预防性的；防止的) medicine as well as a wide variety of training grounds for military personnel(（公司、组织或军队中的）全体人员，员工；人事部门). APG is also a job creator. It provides 400 million dollars in payroll(工资名单；（公司的）发放工资总额) annually(每年，一年一次地), and nearly half a billion dollars in contracts([经]合同；[法]契约). Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today.

Any questions for the congresswoman from Maryland?

NO.

Those in favor(较喜欢；偏袒；有利于) of removing the Aberdeen proving ground from the list of closure?

Aye. 

So noted an removed.

Okay, we'll next consider the Philadelphia naval(海军的，军舰的) shipyard. Would the congressman from Pennsylvania's first district like to offer testimony?

I have no testimony to offer.

Yes, but the difference that we're gonna make...

Uh, Terry, let me call you right back.

Terry Womack?

possibly.

I've had three members of the Black Caucus tell me they're backing my play for the speakership.

Interesting.

I have a sense you've been dissminating(传播) some misinformation(误报；错误的消息).

No, I'm afraid it's you who are misinformated, David. You don't have three members backing you, you have ten.

I made it very clear I didn't want any part of this.

Yes, you made it crystal(结晶，晶体；水晶；水晶玻璃) clear.

then why are you telling people?

because they don't konw you made it crystal clear.

I have to go to Bob with this.

He'll think you organized a coup, get cold feet, and are making me the scapegoat(代人受过者，替罪羊).

David, if I pick up this phone right now and leak this story, Bob will have no choice but to drop you, even if he believes your version of events.

You wanna take a seat?

Uh, Freddy?

Yeah, Frank?

You better make it a half order. I got a big dinner tonight.

Sure thing.(没问题)

Salar?

Always.

you got it. Here you go.(来了)

so, what's the latest?

oh, you know, Frank. same old shit.(还是老样子) almost get killed last weekend.

here?

no.

state fair(集市，展览会) down in Virginia. me and my brother hauling this smoker down there, and this fucking minivan(小型货车) had a fridge(冰箱) strapped(用带子）束住，捆绑) on top. well, that fridge slipped loose. Boom, right in front of us. I had to swerve(（使）突然转向，（使）急转弯) to the left. Barely(勉强才能；几乎不，几乎没有；刚刚) missed it. but now that smoker is fishtailing(鱼尾状的 | vi. 摆尾飞行). almost hit a hatchback(仓门式汽车，掀背式汽车) in the next lane(车道). Swerved to the right. Barely missed that too. but, you know, that's why God gave us reflexes(反应；条件反射). so we can move the fuck out of the way when a fridge come out of Nowwhere.

how them ribs?

you know how they are. 

you know I like to hear it.

Perfection(无可挑剔), Freddy.

you go on ahead, Frank.

Thank you, Freddy.

Well, this is a surprise. you usually text, where are you?

on the other side of the tracks, trying to find the meaning of life.

did you find anything for me?

you mean anything newsworthy(有新闻价值的)?

uh, I actually(实际上，事实上) didn't call to badger(纠缠不休；吵着要；烦扰) you.

yes, you did, but that's part of your charm(魅力，魔力).

no, I wanted to tell you that I've been promoted to white house correspondent. I'll have to travel with the press crops, be at briefings. but I can work around all that. If you need me, it won't change anything.

oh, on the contrary(相反的，相对的), this changes everything.

no, I can be flexible(变通).

I'm not interested in someone who's flexible. I'm interested in someone who's available.

so you think I should turn it down?(我应该拒绝？)

that't entirely up to you. (这完全取决于你)

well, I mean, it's not official yet. I could...

oh, look, I've got to go, but call me, you know, if you find yourself available again. you see, Freddy believes that if a fridge falls off a minivan, you better swerve out of its way. I believe it's the fridge's job to swerve out of mine.

hey, Jannie, keep walking, Zoe, I really don't want to talk to you right now.

It's not like I asked him for it. He just called me into his office, and...

oh, please. you've been gunning(射击；用枪打猎) for my job since the day you bounced in here, with a lollipop(棒棒糖) in your mounth. Congratulations. I'll send you a bottle of champagne(香槟) from the Middle West. wherever the fuch that is.

I' gonna turn it down, you don't have to leave.

Are you trying to rub this or something?

please believe me, you should be in the white house. I don't want it. I never did. I was hoping we could go see Tom together. I want him to know that we both ...

get the fuch out of my face.

I'm asking, for real. I don't want the job.

then you're an even bigger idiot than I thought you were. go, before I get violent(暴力的；（人）有暴力倾向的).

yeah, I see, But the Bering Sea is a violent and unpredictable(无法预测的，不定的) force.

Hi, I work with you dad.

He's not here.

where'd he go?

I don't know. he said he'd be back in a little while.

uh, when was that?

when he dropped us home from school.

he left his phone here. are you dad's girlfriend?

no, no, I, uh... I just.. I work for you dad.

then why do you have the keys to his apartment?

will you make us pop-tarts(挞（tart 的复数）；果馅饼)?

An enormous 60-foot rogue wave struck the Aleutain...

It was just sublime(崇高的，壮丽的，令人赞叹的), Claire.

Thank you. 

I don't think I'll eat for a week. 

Does that mean no room for dessert?

I'd love to, but, uh, none for me.

why don't you and I head downstairs for a little brandy and some cigars?

Cubans(古巴的)?

you don't think I smoke anything legal, do you?

Dessert(（正餐后的）甜点) for you?

No, no, thanks. But I will take a refill Chardonnay, though.

of course.

oh, this is almost out. I'll grab(攫取，抓住；（尤指匆忙地）取，吃) another.

I hate how they just hit you like that with no warning.

you get night sweats(流汗，出汗，冒汗) too?

I, uh, this is very new to me.

Does Frank know?

I haven't... we haven't... No

I'm sorry. we don't have to talk about this.

No, it's fine. I'm just, uh, it's fine. I feel better now.

Could I have a little bit more?

sure.

just say when(够了). Charles is diving tonight, so...

and when.

cheers.

cheers.

so you mentioned, when you invited me, the CWI. you're having a gala(盛会，庆典) and launching some new...

yes, that's right. we just brought on this brilliant(巧妙的，使人印象深的；成功的，辉煌的) young woman who's going to help us expand our efforts overseas. so we'll...

Claire, I will save you the trouble.

Charles and I would be delighted(高兴；令人高兴的人或物，乐事) to contribute.

well, that's very generous(慷慨的，大方的；大量的) of you, Felicity.

well, you were such a darling, getting us tickets to the Jefferson Ball.

oh, that was nothing.

it wasn't nothing. it was.. people in this town don't go out of their way to be nice to each other. Fourteen years Charles and I have been here, and... anyway, um, I'm greatful to have a friend.

How much do you need?

Christina, what the fuck are you doing here?

shh, they're sleeping.

Peter.

hey, dad.

hey, kiddo(老兄；老姐). 

would you take your brother downstairs?

I'll be there in a second.

okay.

where are they going?

I'm taking them to their grandmother's.

I was able to get a hold of Madeleine, and I told her...

oh, fuch, you didn't tell her?

no, I didn't, but I should have.

I told her that you had to travel for work. which is the last time I ever lie for you.

look.

what happened, Peter?

I'm, I'm sorry about the Brack hearing. I was...

Fuck the Brack hearing. what about your kids?

After I drop them off, I'm done. I am no longger your girlfriend, I no longer work for you. I don't want to hear it, Peter. There's no excuse this time.

I don't have much time, Frank.

I'll make it short.

The president?

No, the speakership(议长的职位). David's making a play.

what?

he came to me for support. my first through was to tell you right away, but then my second through was to ignore my first throught because we have the votes, Bob.

If there had been a party revolt(叛乱，造反；反抗), I wouldn't know about it.

we don't need the whole party to revolt, we need 13, we don't need the whole party to revolt. we need 13, 13 Democrats, plus the other side of the aisle.

are you out of your mind?

people have been asking me that a lot lately. I'm inclined(（使）倾向于；点头；（使）倾斜；赞同（某人，某事）) to start saying yes.

who are they... the 13?

David and I are two, Terry Womack and ten members of the black caucus make another 11.

is the precedent behind this?

no, he doesn't have a clue(线索，提示；理解，想法).

This was David's plan executed by me. But there is an out for you, Bod. I can sway Womack either way as long as you make him the next majority leader. and...

the education bill.

now we're on the same page.

I can't do that. you know I can't.

you're the speaker, Bob. you can do anything you'd like. and I have to say, appointing the first African-American majority leader... why, that isn't a bad legacy(遗产，遗赠物) to have.

I'm sorry. I changed my mind. I thought about it, and...

thinking about it was what those two days were for.

and then I thought about it some more, and I realized I...

Jesus Christ. you're fucking unbelievable.

look, Tom, I appreciate the fact that you took a chance on me, but...

no, I don't think you do. I don't think you appreciate anything. I think you're an ungreatful, self-entitled little c

little what, Tom? say it. 

cunt, you're a cunt(<俚>阴道，女性阴部；<俚>讨厌鬼，恶人).

what are you doing?

don't you dare(激，激将；敢于，胆敢)

yo.u don't even know what I'm typing

get out, Zoe. 

just a second. I'm almost done.

get out, you're fired.

whatever you have to tell yourself, Tom.

get out.

so should I press send. I think I should. call me whatever you want. but you should remember, these days, when you're talking to one person, you're talking to a thousand.

well, you'll say you wanted to spend more time focusing on your home district. you'll say Womack is the right man to fill your shoes.(接替你的职务) You won't make waves, You won't do interviews. you'll suck(吸，吮，啜；含在嘴里吸食) it up and be a team player.

That was Frank's idea.

I told you he was gonna try to blame me on it.

Ask around. Talk to Womack.

I did, he said you came to him.

he's fucking lying, Bob, I would never...

shut up, David. Do you understand how you're to behave(行为) when we make the announcement?

and if I don't play along?(如果我不合作呢？)

then the D-triple-C will pour(倾倒，倒出) everything it's got into your primary opponent's(对手，竞争者) campaign next cycle. we'll cleave(裂开；披荆斩棘地前进；粘住；坚持) you from the herd(她（she的宾格）；她的（she的所有格）；她（指某个国家；一艘船）). and watch you die in the wilderness(未开发的地区，荒野；荒芜的地方，杂草丛生处).

Tell us now, David.

If you think it's best, Robert.

and just think, he could have been a wolf.

you made yourself available.

I quit. fuck that place. it was a prison. I'm free now.

Congratulations.

where are you?

in a car.

so am I.

where you headed?

home.

so am I.

to your home or mine.

is that an invitation.

is whatever you want it to be.

you sound tipsy(微醉的，略有醉意的；歪曲的，不稳的).

i am. i just spent the last two hours drinking Long Island Ice Teas.

what's your address?

do your parents know you live like this?

no, they haven't visited.

are you care for?

how do you mean?

Do you have a man who cares for you?

an older man.

no.

but you've been with older man before?

yes.

then you know they hurt you. and after they hurt you, they discard(扔掉，弃置；打出（无用的牌），垫（牌）) you.

you can't hurt me.

take your heels(脚后跟；鞋后跟；高跟鞋) off.
