## What Is Scrum? Agile Coach (2018)

(lighthearted music)
lighthearted: 快乐的，心情愉快的；无忧无虑的

Hi, I'm Megan Cook. Group Product Manager for Jira Software at Atlassian, the makers of Jira and other collaboration tools.
collaboration: 合作，协作；勾结，通敌；合作成果

In this series you'll get an intro to Scrum, an agile framework to help your team get organised, iterate, and continuously improve the projects or products you're working on.
organise：/ˈɔːɡənaɪz/ 有组织的；组织起来的
iterate：/ˈɪtəreɪt/ 迭代；重复

At Atlassian we like to say that great teams have the right practises, and the right people, and the right tools.
practise：/ˈpræktɪs/ 练习，实践

This series will cover the practises and people, along with some of the key scrum artefacts.
artefact：/ˈɑːtɪfækt/ 手工制品，人造物；[医]假象，人为现象

There are also many tools you can use to manage those artefacts, like Jira, not that we're biassed, which we'll get into in other series.
bias: /ˈbaɪəs/ 偏见，成见

Follow our channel for the whole course on that.

This episode is a high-level overview of Scrum, so we can have a good baseline before getting into more detail.
episode：/ˈepɪsəʊd/ 一段经历，一段时期；（电视剧或广播剧的）集，一集；

Over the course of this Intro to Scrum series, we'll show more about the process and ceremonies, the roles that each scrum team must have, and the artefacts they will collect along the way.
ceremony: /ˈserəməni/ 仪式，典礼；礼节


By the end of the series, you'll have a good understanding of what Scrum is, why so many teams use it, and how it works, so that you can start implementing or improving the framework with your team.

So let's begin with the basics, What Scrum is and why it's awesome.
basic：/ˈbeɪsɪk/ 最重要的，基本的
awesome：/ˈɔːsəm/ 让人惊叹的，令人敬畏的；非常棒的，极佳的

Scrum is an agile project management framework that teams use to develop, deliver, and sustain complex products.
management：/ˈmænɪdʒmənt/ 经营，管理，安排
sustain：/səˈsteɪn/ 维持，保持

You may hear people use Scrum and Agile interchangeably, but spoiler alert, they're wrong.
interchangeably：/ˌɪntəˈtʃeɪndʒəbl/ 可互换的；可交换的；可交替的
spoiler：/ˈspɔɪlə(r)/ （飞机）阻流板；（汽车）气流偏导器；选举中的搅局者；把事搞砸的人（或事物）；剧透；抵消影响的报道

Scrum is about continuously shipping value to customers.
ship：运送，运输；遣送（某人）；推出

It's framework for getting work done.

While Agile is a set of values and principles. An all-star.

This means that it usually comes with significant cultural change.
significant：/sɪɡˈnɪfɪkənt/ 显著的，相当数量的；重要的
cultural：/ˈkʌltʃərəl/ 文化的，与文化有关的；艺术的，文艺的

You can't really just go Agile, as it takes a lot more to change the way that you think than it does to change the way that you work.

But you can use a framework like Scrum to help you start thinking in a more agile way and practise building agile principles into your communication and your work.
communication：表达，交流，交际；信息，书信，电话；通讯，交通联系；传播学

Teams of all kinds use Scrum. HR, marketing, design, and more. But perhaps the most common is software development and engineering.

It's a favourite framework for many development teams for a few reasons. Software is a living breathing thing. Requirements change, goals change, situations change. Scrum embraces those changes.
favourite：/ˈfeɪvərɪt/ 特别受喜爱的
breath：/breθ/ 呼吸，气息；一次吸入的空气；（风或气流的）一丝，丝毫；微量，迹象；一瞬间
situation：情况，形势；重要问题，突发情况
embrace：/ɪmˈbreɪs/ 拥抱；欣然接受，乐意采纳

With Scrum, a product is built in a series of iterations called sprints. They break down big, complex projects into bite-sized pieces.
iteration：/ˌɪtəˈreɪʃn/ 迭代；（计算机）新版软件；重申，复述；反复演算

This makes projects more manageable, allows teams to ship high quality work faster and more frequently, and gives them more flexibility to adapt and change.
flexibility：/ˌfleksəˈbɪləti/ 灵活性；弹性，柔性
adapt：/əˈdæpt/ 适应；调整，使适合；改编；改造，改装

Scrums transparency and iterate framework also help overcome many of the recurring problems people often experience in waterfall projects.
transparency：/trænsˈpærənsi/ 透明，透明性；幻灯片，透明正片；透明度，清晰度，公开度；显而易见，一目了然
overcome：v. 克服，解决；征服，战胜；使受不了，使无法行动（或思考）
recur：/rɪˈkɜː(r)/ v. 再发生，反复出现；（思考或讲话时）重新回到，反复提及（recur to）；（小数）循环
experience: /ɪkˈspɪəriəns/ n. v. 经历，遭遇；体会到，感受到
waterfall: 瀑布；瀑布似的东西

Short iterations make it possible to reduce risk and cost, get fast feedback from users, increase speed to market and see value quicker.
increase: v. 增长，增强，增大

Milestones, like the end of the sprint, also come frequently and give teams the sense of regular tangible progress.
tangible: /ˈtændʒəb(ə)l/ adj. 明确的，真实的；可触摸的，可感知的

This helps them stay focused and energised, which increases employee engagement and satisfaction.
energise: /ˈenəˌdʒaɪz/ vt. 供给……能量；使精力充沛（等于 energize）


engagement: 婚约，订婚；约会，约定；交战，战斗；演出任务；聘用，雇用；参加，从事；(与……的)密切关系，(对……的)了解；啮合；（与……的）密切关系，（对……的）了解
satisfaction: 满意，称心；（对需求或欲望的）满足；（抗议、投诉等的）妥善处理；乐事，快事；<法律>（债务等的）清偿，（义务等的）履行；赔偿，补偿；<史>通过决斗维护荣誉的机会；（基督教神学）基督替世人赎罪

With benefits like these, it's easy to see why Scrum is a favourite framework for all kinds of teams.

But how exactly does it work? Check out our next video to find out.

## How Scrum Works - Agile Coach (2018)

(light upbeat music)
upbeat: adj. 乐观的，积极向上的

At its core, scrum is all about continuous learning and adjusting to change.
adjust: 调整，调节；整理（衣服）；适应，习惯；（保险理赔时）理算，评估（损失，损害）

It acknowledges that we don't know everything at the start of a project, and it's structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing market conditions and user requirements.
acknowledge: /əkˈnɒlɪdʒ/ 承认；认可； 跟……打招呼，理会；告知收到；（公开）感谢
structure: n. 结构，构造；结构体，（尤指）大型建筑物；周密安排，精心组织；机构，组织，体系v. 计划，组织，安排

Hi, I'm Megan Cook, group product manager for Jira Software at Atlassian, the makers of Jira and other collaboration tools.
collaboration: 合作，协作；勾结，通敌；合作成果

In our last episode, we talked about what scrum is and why so many teams think that it's an awesome framework for getting work done, especially big, complex projects.
episode：/ˈepɪsəʊd/ 一段经历，一段时期；（电视剧或广播剧的）集，一集；
awesome：/ˈɔːsəm/ 让人惊叹的，令人敬畏的；非常棒的，极佳的

Now that you have a good baseline, let's take a closer look at how it works.

Scrum revolves around short, iterative release cycles, or sprints, that allow you to ship often, reprioritize when needed, and constantly improve.
revolve: /rɪˈvɒlv/ v. （使）旋转；围绕……旋转（revolve around）；以……为最重要内容，以……为中心（revolve around）；反复思考，反复斟酌；循环出现
iterative: /ˈɪtərətɪv/ adj. [数] 迭代的；重复的，反复的
reprioritize: 变更优先顺序
constantly: adv. 总是，经常地，不断地

Here's how it works.

As a development team sets out to build a new product or improve an existing one, they have a long list of stories, features, requirements, enhancers, and fixes to work on.
enhance: /ɪnˈhɑːns/ v. 增强，提高，改善

This is called the product backlog. 

Think of it as a running to-do list.

Every few weeks the team plans which of the tasks from that backlog they'll work on during the next sprint, the short time period when a potentially shippable increment of work is created.
potentially: /pəˈtenʃəli/ adv. 可能地，潜在地
shippable: adj. 可装运的，可运输的
increment:  /ˈɪŋkrəmənt/ 增长

Sprints are normally around two weeks, but your team can decide on a length that works for you.

Throughout the sprint, the team participates in a number of events on a regular basis, often called ceremonies.
Throughout: /θruːˈaʊt/ 遍及，到处；自始至终，贯穿整个时期
participate: v. 参加，参与；<古>分担，分享；<古>具有，带有（特殊的性质）
basis: 基础，要素；基准，方式；理由，根据；主要成分（或部分）
ceremony: /ˈserəməni/ 仪式，典礼；礼节

These ceremonies are the hallmarks of the scrum framework.
hallmark: /ˈhɔːlmɑːk/ 特点，特征

They create regularity and help teams maintain transparent, clear communication; adapt to change; and continuously learn.
regularity: n. 规律性，经常性
maintain: v. 保持，维持；维修
adapt: v. 适应；调整

The key ceremonies are sprint planning, daily scrum or standup, sprint reviews, and sprint retrospectives.
ceremony: /ˈserəməni/ 仪式，典礼；礼节
retrospective : adj. 回顾的，回想的；有追溯效力的，溯及既往的n. （艺术家作品）回顾展

Let's start with sprint planning.

During this ceremony, your team decides what you want to accomplish during the next sprint.
accomplish: v. 完成，实现

Then you work together to move tasks and stories from the backlog to the sprint in order to meet the sprint goal, keeping in mind what's feasible to complete in two weeks.
goal: /ɡəʊl/ n. 球门；进球得分；目标，目的；（旅行）目的地；（赛跑的）终点
feasible: /ˈfiːzəb(ə)l/ adj. 可行的，办得到的；很可能会发生的

During each day of the sprint, you and your team have a daily scrum or standup.

This is a super short meeting that happens at the same time and in the same place.

It's usually in the morning and lasts for about 15 minutes, but you can make it shorter or longer if needed.

It should be quick though; don't let it turn into an hour-long meeting that gets in the way of other work.

The goal of the daily scrum is to get everyone on the same page.

It's also a time to voice any concerns you have or things that may be blocking you from making progress toward the sprint goal.
voice: v. 表达，吐露（感情或意见）
concern: /kənˈsɜːn/ n. 担心，忧虑

At the end of the sprint, the team gets together for a sprint review, an informal session to view a demo and see what was accomplished.
accomplish: v. 完成，实现

This review meeting is when the development team shows off the backlog items they've finished to the product owner, who approves them for the release.

The product owner also reworks the backlog based on the current sprint, and that serves as a starting point for the next sprint planning session.

The last step of every sprint is the retrospective, where the team comes together to talk about, and document, what worked well and what didn't work.
retrospective : adj. 回顾的，回想的；有追溯效力的，溯及既往的n. （艺术家作品）回顾展

The retrospective could be about the sprint, the project, the people and the relationships, tools, or even certain ceremonies.

The idea isn't to dwell on what went wrong, but to create a safe space where the team can talk about what went well, and what needs to be improved the next time.
dwell: /dwel/ v. 居住，栖身；总是想着，唠叨（dwell on）

So, to recap, the four scrum ceremonies are sprint planning, daily scrum or standup, sprint reviews, and sprint retrospectives.
recap: /ˈriːkæp/ v. 扼要重述，摘要说明；翻新胎面

These are the practises that will hold your process together.

But these practises don't run themselves; that's where the people come in.

We'll talk more about that, and the roles each person plays, in our next video.

Stay tuned, and follow our channel for an even deeper dive into each of these ceremonies along with other helpful tips on how to get started with scrum.
tune: /tjuːn/ n. 曲调，曲子；歌曲，乐段v. （给乐器）调音，校音
dive: /daɪv/ v. 跳水；潜水；突然大幅贬值，暴跌；下降，下潜；扑向，冲向

## Scrum Roles Explained - Agile Coach (2018)

(upbeat music)

Now, let's talk a little bit more about the people involved in these ceremonies.
ceremony: /ˈserəməni/ 仪式，典礼；礼节

There are three primary roles in the Scrum framework. Product owners, Scrum masters, and the development teams.

Hi, I'm Megan Cook, Group Product Manager for Jira Software at Atlassian, the makers of Jira and other collaboration tools.
collaboration: 合作，协作；勾结，通敌；合作成果

In our last episode, we talked about how Scrum works and the four ceremonies that serve as the glue, that holds the framework together.
episode：/ˈepɪsəʊd/ 一段经历，一段时期；（电视剧或广播剧的）集，一集；
glue: /ɡluː/ 胶水；凝聚力

Sprint planning, daily scrum or standup, sprint reviews, and sprint retrospectives.
retrospective : adj. 回顾的，回想的；有追溯效力的，溯及既往的n. （艺术家作品）回顾展

Those are the practises in the Scrum equation.
equation: /ɪˈkweɪʒ(ə)n/ n. 等式，方程（式）；等同（看待）；

Scrum product owners are the champions for their product.
champion: /ˈtʃæmpiən/ n. 冠军

Their main job is to bring the product vision to life and have a constant pulse on the market and the customer.
pulse: /pʌls/ n. 脉搏，脉率

They're focused on understanding business and market requirements, then prioritising the work that the development team will do.
prioritise: /praɪˈɒrətaɪz/ 给予……优先权；按优先顺序处理

Scrum masters are the Scrum experts within their team.

They coach developers, product owners, and the business on the Scrum process and look for ways to fine-tune their practise.
coach: v. 训练，指导
fine-tune: 调整；使有规则；对进行微调

Scrum masters are referred to as the Servant Leader by the official Scrum guide.
refer: 提到，谈及（refer to）；描述，涉及（refer to）；查阅，参考（refer to）；将……送交给（以求获得帮助等）；让（某人）注意；<古>把……归因于；（考试中）淘汰（应试者）
Servant: /ˈsɜːvənt/ n. 仆人，佣人; 雇员，职员

Scrum development teams are the developers and designers,the people who do the day in and day out work to accomplish the sprint goals, and who collaborate with the product owners to forecast how much work they can complete in each sprint.
day in and day out work: 日复一日的工作
collaborate: /kəˈlæbəreɪt/ v. 合作，协作；勾结，通敌
forecast: /ˈfɔːkɑːst/ v. 预测，预报

They also think about how to improve development practises as they learn what works best.

Together the development teams, Scrum master, and product owner are the people who will keep your project and Scrum practise moving in the right direction.

We'll talk more about the responsibilities and best practises for each of these roles in another series.

so follow our channel to watch that episode and learn everything you need to know about the basics of Scrum.
basic: /ˈbeɪsɪk/ n. 基础；基本要素

Now, along the way, the development team, Scrum master, and product owner, will collect artefacts as they go through each ceremony.
artefact：/ˈɑːtɪfækt/ 手工制品，人造物；[医]假象，人为现象

That's the topic of our next video.

Check it out to learn more about Scrum artefacts.

(upbeat music)

## Scrum Artifacts - Agile Coach (2018)

[Music]

Throughout the process your team will collect artifacts, that's the topic of today's episode. 
Throughout: /θruːˈaʊt/ 遍及，到处；自始至终，贯穿整个时期
artefact：/ˈɑːtɪfækt/ 手工制品，人造物；[医]假象，人为现象
episode：/ˈepɪsəʊd/ 一段经历，一段时期；（电视剧或广播剧的）集，一集；

Artifacts is something you make like a tool to solve a problem. 

In scrum the three main artifacts are the product backlog, the sprint backlog and the increment with your definition of done.
definition: n. 定义，释义；榜样，典范；清晰，清晰度，鲜明度

they're the three constants that you'll continue to revisit and invest in over time.
revisit: /ˌriːˈvɪzɪt/ vt. 重游；再访；重临
invest: /ɪnˈvest/ v. 投资；投入（时间或精力）；赋予，授予；<旧>给……穿衣；<旧>包围，围攻

Hello Megan Cook here. Group product manager for JIRA software at Atlassian, the makers of JIRA and other collaboration tools. 
collaboration: 合作，协作；勾结，通敌；合作成果

In this series we've been discussing the practices and the
people needed to use scrum.
 
We talked about how scrum works and the ceremonies your team will go through as well as the roles each person will play in the process.

First you have your product backlog, that master to-do list of user stories, features requirements, enhancements and fixes.
enhancement: n. 增加，增强，改善

The product owner maintains this and uses it to plan your sprint backlog which is the list of items of user stories that the development team is working on in the current sprint to complete the increment which is also known as the Sprint goal
maintain: v. 保持，维持；维修，保养
increment: /ˈɪŋkrəmənt/ n. <正式>（尤指连续、定量的）增长

This is the third strong artifact. The increment is the usable end product from a sprint. 

At Atlassian, we usually show off the increment during the end of Sprint demo, where the team shares what was completed in the sprint. 

Some teams consider the increment to be whatever their definition of done is a milestone, a sprint goal, or the full version of shippable product, regardless of whether or not it's actually shipped. 
definition: n. 定义，释义；榜样
shippable: adj. 可装运的，可运输的
regardless: adv. 不顾，不加理会

Every team has a different definition of done there, so make sure to work with your team to clarify yours.
clarify: /ˈklærəfaɪ/ v. 澄清，阐明；（通过加热）使净化，使纯净

And speaking of done, you're done with this intro to scrum series. 

Now you're familiar with the basics of what scrum is, why so many teams use it, and how it works, including the ceremonies roles and artifacts we're just getting started, so make sure to follow our channel for the latest episodes, and watch the next series about sprint planning

[Music]

## Sprint Planning Basics - Agile Coach (2019)

[Music]

Sprint planning is a ceremony that helps focus execution, minimize surprises and guarantee overall higher quality code.
execution: /ˌeksɪˈkjuːʃ(ə)n/ n. 执行，实施，完成

The process usually takes about an hour per week of iteration. Like, two hours for a two-week sprint.
iteration: /ˌɪtəˈreɪʃn/ n. 迭代

And it should ideally be done early in the week, so your team's flow isn't disrupted by the weekend.
ideally: adv. 理想地；观念上地
disrupt: /dɪsˈrʌpt/ v. 中断，扰乱

I'm Megan cook, Group product manager for JIRA software at Atlassian, the makers of JIRA and other collaboration tools.
collaboration: 合作，协作；勾结，通敌；合作成果

In our last series we talked about what scrum is, why it's awesome, and how it works, including the events or ceremonies that happen throughout the framework
awesome：/ˈɔːsəm/ 让人惊叹的，令人敬畏的；非常棒的，极佳的
Throughout: /θruːˈaʊt/ 遍及，到处；自始至终，贯穿整个时期

Now in this series, we'll dive deeper into one of the key ceremonies at the beginning of the sprint, sprint planning.
dive: /daɪv/ v. 跳水；潜水；突然大幅贬值，暴跌；下降，下潜；扑向，冲向

During the sprint planning process, your product owner, scrum master and development team will come together to discuss two key questions. What can we deliver during the upcoming sprint in order to achieve the Sprint goal? And how will we deliver that work?
upcoming: adj. 即将来临的

These questions help everyone agree on a goal for the Sprint, map out the next two weeks of work, or whatever your sprint duration is, and set the team up for success. 

At Atlassian, we've developed a three step process that has worked really well for our team sprint planning.

Check out the next video to see how it works.

[Music]

## Backlog Grooming - Agile Coach (2019)

At Atlassian we've developed a three-step sprint planning process that has worked really well for our teams. 

The first step is backlog grooming meeting.
groom: /ɡruːm/ v. (给动物）擦洗，刷洗；（动物为自己或另一动物）梳理毛发；梳妆，打扮；修饰，修整（某物）；培训，使做好准备；（尤指透过网际网路）勾引，诱奸（儿童）

The second step is the actual planning session.

And the third step is creating your first few action items. 

Let's take a deeper dive into each of these steps and talk about the details.
dive: /daɪv/ v. 跳水；潜水；突然大幅贬值，暴跌；下降，下潜；扑向，冲向

Hi Megan cook here. Group product manager for JIRA software at Atlassian, the makers of JIRA and other collaboration tools. 
collaboration: 合作，协作；勾结，通敌；合作成果

So in our last episode we talked about what sprint planning is, and how it helps focus execution, minimize surprises, and guarantee overall higher quality code.
episode：/ˈepɪsəʊd/ 一段经历，一段时期；（电视剧或广播剧的）集，一集；

Now let's take a closer look at how to do it. 

The first step the backlog grooming meeting, is something that many developers will cringe at, because it involves holding a meeting before the meeting.
cringe: /krɪndʒ/ v. 退缩，畏缩；厌恶，反感；感到难堪，觉得难为情

The good news developers may be excused from it, and there's actually a purpose behind this approach, to save time during the actual sprint planning session, and make that meeting more productive. 

You see sprint planning involves two key toss, grooming the backlog and deciding which work to complete in the upcoming sprint. 

At Atlassian we found that the backlog grooming is best done beforehand in a separate meeting with the product owner and scrum master. 

We make this pre meeting optional for the full development team. 

Regardless of whether they attend, you'll need at least 30
minutes to triage the issues you're most likely to take on in the next two sprints. 

Sometimes you'll find items that don't have enough detail to be executed, or need more information from the product owner. 

And that's the beauty of grooming the backlog in advance. 

Those gaps can be filled in between meetings so that there aren't any blockers or time wasters during the actual sprint planning meeting. 

Check out the next video to learn all the ins and outs of a successful sprint planning meeting.

## Sprint Planning Meetings - Agile Coach (2019)

[Music]

So now last episode we talked about what sprint planning is and how it helps focus execution, minimize surprises and guarantee overall higher quality code.
episode：/ˈepɪsəʊd/ 一段经历，一段时期；（电视剧或广播剧的）集，一集；

Hi, I'm Meghan cook group product manager for JIRA software at Atlassian, the makers of JIRA and other collaboration tools.
collaboration: 合作，协作；勾结，通敌；合作成果

Let's begin with the actual sprint planning ceremony, and walk through a simple agenda, so you can see what's covered during this meeting.
agenda: /əˈdʒendə/ n. 待议事项，议事日程；（政治）议题；秘密计划，秘密目标

First is the retrospective recap.
retrospective : adj. 回顾的，回想的；有追溯效力的，溯及既往的n. （艺术家作品）回顾展
recap: /ˈriːkæp/ v. 扼要重述，摘要说明；翻新胎面

Next, comes the product and marketing updates.

And third is the planning conversation. 

The session starts with the scrum master, presenting any relevant action items from the retrospective.
present: v. 赠送，呈现

Then, the product owner provides product or market updates, say everyone is on the same page and understands the broader context.
broader: /brɔːdə/ adj. 广大的；一片的比较级

After the debriefs, the product owner starts the actual planning conversation, by working with the development team, to set a sprint goal and determine their velocity.
debrief: /ˌdiːˈbriːf/ v. 盘问
determine: /dɪˈtɜːmɪn/ v. 决定，控制；查明，确定
velocity: /vəˈlɒsəti/ n. 速度，速率

One of the biggest challenges during sprint planning, is often prioritization. 
prioritization: /praɪˌɒrətaɪˈzeɪʃn/ n. 优先次序；优化；优先化

So having a focused sprint goal, and data like your average velocity, can help inform the conversation and can make things easier.
average: /ˈævərɪdʒ/ n. 平均水平，一般标准 adj. 普通的，平常的；不好不坏的；平均（数）的；中等的，适中的
velocity: /vəˈlɒsəti/ n. 速度，速率

The sprinkle is an objective that can be met by implementing stories from the backlog.
sprinkle: /ˈsprɪŋk(ə)l/ n. 少量，一点

It provides guidance to the development team on the why,or the purpose of their work.

Using data points, like the team's average velocity, also helps with prioritization.

Your average velocity is the amount of work typically completed in a sprint.
typically: /ˈtɪpɪkli/ adv. 典型地，有代表性地；一般，通常；一向如此地，不出所料地

Once you set a sprint goal and determine a starting velocity, you're ready to plan the sprint.
determine: /dɪˈtɜːmɪn/ v. 决定，控制；查明，确定

This is when everyone walks through the story's being suggested for the Sprint, and discusses the work required to complete each one. 

This is the longest part of Sprint planning. 

And it's tempting to rush through or skip steps, but one of my biggest pieces of advice is to take your time, and be thorough at this take.
tempt: v. 引诱，诱惑；怂恿，利诱；冒……的风险
thorough: /ˈθʌrə/ adj. 彻底的，全面的；彻头彻尾的，十足的；仔细的，缜密的；仔细周到，工作缜密

A little more time up front makes a big difference later on.

So, as you navigate the planning conversation and come to a consensus, you're ready for the final step of the process: recapping the plan and each person's first action item.
consensus: /kənˈsensəs/ n. 一致看法，共识
recap: /ˈriːkæp/ v. 扼要重述，摘要说明；翻新胎面

After all the conversation, everyone will be wanting to wrap up and get to work.

But it's good practice to just take a few more minutes to summarize the next steps.
summarize: v. 总结，概述

Get the bull approval from everyone in the room about what the team is actually committing to shipping at the end of the sprint. 

And confirm which tasks each person is starting on to make sure no one is duplicating work.
duplicate: /ˈdjuːplɪkeɪt/ v. 复制，复印；（无必要地）重复（某事）；使成倍增加

Now as you can see steps 2 & 3 represent the bulk of the sprint planning process. 

It may seem a bit daunting at first, but we have tons of tips for how to make things go faster and smoother.
daunt: /dɔːnt/ v. 使胆怯，使气馁；威吓 

that's where we'll pick up on the next episode. see you there.

## Daily Standups: How to Run Them - Agile Coach (2019)

[Music]

Stand-ups are 15-minute daily meetings that keep everyone in the note and connected throughout the sprint. 

They aren't long meetings where you get into the details of plans or the status of every single task, they're just quick, informative, dare I say fun, check-ins. 

Hi Megan cook here. Group product manager for JIRA software cloud.

In our last series, we talked about sprint planning, the scrum ceremony where your team meets to discuss what you can deliver during the upcoming sprint and how you'll deliver that work. 

Once you've started your sprint, you'll hold stand-ups or daily scrums, that's where we'll pick up today.

In this episode, we'll cover the basics of stand-ups, what they are, when they happen, who attends, and how to run them. 

We'll also share a few tips for success.

Stand-ups are 15 minute daily meetings to quickly plan for the next 24 hours.

They keep everyone on the same page and united as a team.

Sharing each person's successes and plans each day gets everyone excited about the project overall, and their individual contribution. 

Stand-ups also help eliminate all the meetings, identify blockers, make quick decisions, and build a shared understanding of what everyone is working on. 

These meetings are typically done in the morning, preferably at the same time in place, and since they are so short, don't even bother booking a conference room, just remember to gather your development team, your scrum master, and product data in a common area, and have everyone stand up the whole time, hence the name. 

The reason we stand is to keep the high energy and the conversation short. 

Nobody wants to stand for a whole hour. 

Now there are two common ways to do stand-ups, round-robin and walking the board. 

Let's start with round-robin. 

In this method, everyone goes around the circle and shows their answers to three questions, what did I work on yesterday, what am i working on today, and what is blocking me. 

It's important to take turns and pay attention to your teammates, some teams like to have a token that each person holds as they talk to emphasize that only one person should be talking at a time.

However, when someone on the team is talking about a blocker, others should be encouraged to jump in and volunteer to help if they can. 

There's also an implicit accountability in reporting the work that you've completed yesterday in front of your peers. 

No one wants to be that person he's constantly doing the same thing, or not making any progress.

Another common approach is called walking the board. This is where your team walks through all the work you have on your board, who owns it, and if there are any blockers. 

Move right-to-left through the board, talking first about the pieces of work that are closest to done, and how you can work together to get those items shipped. 

These aren't the only two ways to run a stand-up, there are tons of variations and other methods, we recommend doing what's best for you and your team, whatever that may be.

Regardless of the method that you choose, here are a few tips to help you make your stand-ups more productive and effective. 

First, relegate all side conversations to the 16th minute, or after the stand-up is over.

Allow anyone in the group to raise the flag whenever the group is getting off topic, or needs to move along. 

Second, walk into the standup each day knowing what you're going to say, it keeps that energy high, and everyone engaged. 

Also, make stand-ups part of a larger scrum framework, with sprint planning, sprint reviews and retrospectives to help you constantly improve and get the right work done.
retrospective : adj. 回顾的，回想的；有追溯效力的，溯及既往的n. （艺术家作品）回顾展

Speaking of constantly improving, if something's not working, make a change, don't be afraid to get creative, and adapt as things change, that's what scrum and agile are all about. 

So that's all for today's entry to stand-ups, the wait there's more, follow our channel to learn more about the other scrum ceremonies to round out your practice and help make your team's is efficient and effective as possible

## Sprint Review Meetings - Agile Coach (2019)

I've a confession to make.

I love sprint reviews.

A sprint review or demo is so much more than a meeting.

Demos are the cornerstone on which you can build better software, stronger teams and a healthier culture.

Hi, I'm Megan Cook, group prod manager for Jira Software Cloud.

In today's episode, we'll talk about sprint reviews, the purpose they serve, the attendees and their roles, and steps for running them.

By now you should know the basics of planning a sprint, and how to do daily stand-ups.

Now imagine you've reached the end of your sprint.

Alright, it's time to show off your work and reflect on how things went at the sprint review ceremony.

Start by gathering everyone from the scrum master,development team and product owner, to designers, writers and analysts, in a room with a screen
that everyone can see.

You'll need to block a fair amount of time, a safe rule of thumb is five minutes per person, so everyone has five minutes to demo what they're working on.

Now that you've set the stage, it's time to kick off the ceremony.

So how do you do a sprint review?

Well there are four key steps.

Review what's done and not done.

Demo the work.

Review key metrics.

Review and revise the product backlog.
revise: /rɪˈvaɪz/ v. 改变，修正

Let's take a closer look at what happens during each step.

Beginning with step one, review what's done and not done.

The product owner begins the sprint review by reviewing the product backlog and explaining which items are done and not done yet.

Next the development team leads step two, demonstrating the work they've completed.

Think of this as part of the meeting, like show and tell.

Each member of the team demos what they completed and answers questions about what was done and why.

It's a great time to celebrate the team and everyone's accomplishments during an iteration.

However, it's not all celebration.

Earlier the team planned and prioritized this work,

likely with the user's story or ticket, and now has a chance to review what's actually being delivered.

Now the team can ask questions and make observations about the direction that was actually implemented.

Will it satisfy the customer's problem, does it account for internal dependencies.

These demos are invaluable for steering your teammates in the right direction before they push code to production.

At Atlassian we demo each and every week, so the team is constantly course correcting for small decisions before they snowball into big mistakes.
snowball: n. 雪球; vi. 掷雪球；滚雪球般增大

Then in step three, the team reviews the key metrics that they're working towards.
metric: /ˈmetrɪk/ n. 诗韵；衡量标准；度规

Ideally you're delivering working software that does something like improves performance, drives customer behavior, or some other measurable outcome.
ideally: adv. 理想地；观念上地
measurable: /ˈmeʒərəbl/ adj. 显著的，有明显影响的；可测量的
outcome: n. 结果，效果

This meeting is a great time to review these metrics and make sure that what we demo is going to move those metrics and get closer to your goals.
metric: /ˈmetrɪk/ n. 诗韵；衡量标准；度规

The last step is reviewing and revising the product backlog.

Now that the team has seen what has been built, it's good to take another look at what's up next.

Teams often add new user stories, or remove old ones as the implementations and intended effects become clear in the demo.
intend: v. 打算，想要；意指，意思是；准备，预留（作某种用途或给某人用）

If new screen needs fresh design or a copy, we can take this time to kick that project off with design and new works.

The final result of the sprint review ceremony is the revised product backlog that informs the next sprint planning meeting.

If you follow all these steps, you'll have all the bases covered for sprint reviews as part of a traditional scrum brainwork.

If you wanna take it one step further, I'd love to share how at Atlassian we made this ceremony part of a broader demo culture.
broader: /brɔːdə/ adj. 广大的；一片的比较级

We believe that all product teams should have weekly demos with the entire team.

Done well these meetings create alignment across the entire team, shared learning, customer focus and raises the bar for accountability.
accountability: n. 责任，责任心，可说明性

The entire team has a responsibility to ask questions,challenge and share lessons with the presenter.

It isn't just the job of the manager or a boss.

This creates demos that are collaborative, dynamic,energizing and informative for all.
energize: /ˈenədʒaɪz/ vt. 激励；使活跃；供给……能量
informative: adj. 提供有用信息的，增长见闻的

So whether you're standing up for your first sprint review, or you're refining your current practice,

I know these steps will come in handy.

Although sprint reviews happen at the end of a sprint,it's not the final step, that's where retrospectives come in.

## Agile Retrospectives Done Right - Agile Coach (2019)

What if you could wave a magic wand and make your sprints smoother in the future?

Retrospectives may not be magic but they're the next best thing.
retrospective : adj. 回顾的，回想的；有追溯效力的，溯及既往的n. （艺术家作品）回顾展

Retrospectives are a time for your team to reflect on how things went during the last sprint and talk about ways you could improve the next one.

Today we'll give you an intro into retrospectives along with a simple five step process to run them for your team.

Hi, I'm Megan Cook, Group Product Manager for Jira Software Cloud.

Today I'm excited to talk with you about one of the most versatile Scrum ceremonies, retrospectives.

Retrospectives serve a few purposes.

To evaluate how the last sprint went, create a shared understanding of the things that went well and things that didn't, and create a plan for improving the way that your team works.

The retrospective occurs after the sprint review and before the next sprint planning meeting.

It usually takes about 30 minutes per week of iteration so like one hour for a two week sprint.

Every team member should attend the retrospective with a facilitator leading the discussion.

The facilitator can be the scrum master, the product owner, or it can even be anyone in the team, it can rotate throughout.

Feel free to pull in designers, marketers, and anyone who contributed to the current sprint or iteration.

Here's how to do it, there are five basic steps to run through a traditional retrospective.

Prepare.

Set the stage.

What went well?

What needs improvement?

And next steps.

Let's start with step one, a little prep work to make the retrospective as productive as possible.

Make sure you have the following supplies, white board or wall, sticky notes, pens, and a timer.

Clean off the white board or wall to make space for our sticky note exercise later.

Now you're ready for step two, setting the stage.

Retrospectives can be difficult because everyone is under pressure and it's important to set the right culture.

A good way to do this is to remind everyone of the prime directive, a short helpful statement from Norm Kerth.

It reads, "Regardless of what we discover, "we understand and truly believe "that everyone did the best job they could "given what they knew at the time, "their skills and abilities, the resources available, "and situation at hand."

This makes space for our shortcomings and reminds everyone to keep a positive spirit of continuous improvement, to listen with an open mind, and to remain focused on the outcomes in environment, not individual people.

Two tactical things to consider are encouraging everyone to leave their phones and laptops at the door and to set the frame for the conversation.

Are we retro-ing on the last two weeks, two months, or longer?

Make sure you're clear on how far back you're going to go.

These ground rules in mind, you can start the conversation with step three, what went well.

Distribute the sticky notes and pens and set a timer for three to five minutes.

The facilitator can then start the timer and encourage all participants to write down as many ideas as they can.

We're looking to uncover what went well, like team strengths, awesome outcomes that everyone can rally around.

Try to write one brief idea per sticky note.

You'll have time to elaborate on them after.

This is a crucial step because it's easy for retrospectives to turn into complaining sessions that only focus on the negative.

But that's not the goal.

This is also an opportunity to talk about how to make the good even better.

Once the timer is done, the group goes around the room and posts their ideas on the board sharing the idea out loud and creating a shared understanding of what it means.

The team can ask clarifying questions but the discussion should be around empathy and understanding not actions or implications.

Encourage the team to group similar ideas together and get a sense of any themes arising.

This step should take about five minutes for brainstorming and writing and 10 to 20 minutes for running through the themes and getting a shared understanding.

Then repeat the activity in step four, what needs improvement.

Use the same structure as before, but focus on what didn't go great.

Quickly write down actions and outcomes that could have been better.

When sharing resist the temptation to rebuke others or jump straight to solutions.

Have the facilitator table any discussion leading in that direction.

And finally wrap up the retrospective by spending 20 to 25 minutes on next steps.

Having identified what went well and what didn't, what concrete actions can your team take to improve those things?

Allow each team member three votes and spend a moment voting on which ideas the team should take action on.

Once you have a list, agree to which actions you'll take and assign owners and a due date.

At the end of the meeting, thank everyone for their involvement and their honesty.

And quickly run through the list of follow-up items and who is responsible.

And that's it, the basic steps to running a traditional retrospective.
