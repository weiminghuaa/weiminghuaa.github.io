# HOUSE OF CARDS
Adonai
26 de diciembre de 2018

## season 1 

### Chapter 9

that's treason(叛国罪，通敌罪；背叛). now it's time to splatter(啪嗒啪嗒地落下（或击打）；（用粘稠液体）泼溅) your brains everywhere.

please, please don't kill me.

shut up, die like a man.

but I have a wife and family.

that's what happens to cowards(胆小鬼，懦夫).

hey, shh, shh, you have to keep it down. there's an important meeting going on.

sorry.

I'll set you up in the copy room. you won't be in the way there.

this is gonna be a close vote. most of your colleagues are not gonna wanna spend this amount of money in just 25 districts. try persuasion(说服，劝服；说服力) first.

talking point are in your packets. and if you want more detailed information... reacherch, statistics... you can contact Gillian or myself.

and when it comes to doling(按份额发放) out favors, talk to Doug. if favors don't work, come to me directly, Peter.

I'll be campaigning in Pennsylvania. all my events this week will be in counties within the watershed. so I'll be working the media angle. but if you need me to get on the phone with anybody, reach out to Christina. she'll work it into my schedule.

I have to say, Frank. 200 million is going to be a hard sell. the natural gas lobby's already putting up a big fight.

we need to make this about jobs. 

but the drilling industry can offer far more jobs than this bill can.

this bill doesn't threaten those jobs, it just makes sure the drilling is done responsibly. it adds more jobs on top of that. I've already been approached by Sancrop with reelection funds.

I have too. they offered me a donation package from eight different drilling companies.

Remy Danton?

yep.

how many of you been approached by Remy? look, I know it's not easy to turn down money. but if the republicans control redistricting in Pennsylvania, we lose the house next election. and all of you lose your committee chairmanships. this is a feather(羽毛) that we need in Peter's hat. a loss(失去，丧失；亏损；死亡) on this bill endangers(使处于险境，危及) his chance of winning. and we are fighting to keep our majority here. any other concern(担心，忧虑；使人担忧的事物)? I want a first vote count by 4:00 tomorrow afternoon. thank you all very much.

it's brutal(野蛮的，凶残的；毫不掩饰的), 22 stops in three days.

that's a lot of sleeping on the bus.

no sleeping. that bus is the only place I can get work done.

you know, Francis did a big bus tour in 98. and the bus lost its brakes going down a hill. and we landed in a tobacco field. he gets out of the car, knocks on the farmer's door, writes a check for all the damaged crops(庄稼；（谷物或水果的）收成，产量), and then borrows his pickup(小卡车，轻型货车（=pickup truck）) so he doesn't miss the next event. and it was actually fun. he was driving. I was shotgun(霰弹猎枪；猎枪，火枪；滑膛枪；散弹猎枪；副驾驶位). we had the whole staff in the flatbed. we actually got there ten minutes early.

I think I should be here drum(不停地击打；击鼓，打鼓) up votes.

carefull sir, very hot.

look, you and vice president will get national coverage(覆盖范围；新闻报道；保险范围；课程内容；防守，盯守). that's gonna help us with the count.

I reached out to him, he never got back to me. I don't know if he even knows the talking points about the bill.

I don't think Jim wants to go. he's doing it as a favor to the president and I, so it doesn't matter if he doesn't know the talking points. you know, people wanna see him be folksy(有民间风味的；和气的；无拘束的), you know? so just humor(迎合，迁就；顺应) him, show him some degree of...

oh god.

are you okay? it was an accident. okay, it's time for us to go. I'm so sorry.

it's all right, I just need to run it under some cold water.

I'm not going to lie, I despise(鄙视，厌恶，看不起) children. there, I've said it.

you can't act like that in here. you have to be a big boy,

I know.

Peter, we really need to get going. we've already missed one flight because the meeting went over. I booked us another one at 9:25, but...

we have to drop the kids off at school.

it's going to be really tight(紧身的，紧贴的；拉紧的). if we miss this plane, we have to cancel our first event.

Nancy, can you take them?

I've gotta get packets ready for the lunchtime sub-caucuses.

Peter, I'd do it. but we have a meeting with Greenpeace in 20 minutes. I gotta get their rating on the bill.

where's their school?

Connecticut and Q.

oh, I can take them.

you sure?

yes, it's on the way to my office.

this watershed act proves that once again the anti-capitalist(资本主义者；资本家) agenda is alive and well in the Democrstic party. let me show you what's really going on.

here are the democrats eating up all for their. soft science, 'organically(有机地；有组织地；器官上地) homegrown' propaganda(宣传，鼓吹；（罗马天主教的）传信部（Propaganda）). that the eco-fanatics(狂热者；盲信者（fanatic 的复数）) are force-feeding them. and over there, at the tail(（动物的）尾巴；（一些蝴蝶的）狭翅须) end of all those jackasses(公驴；愚蠢的人) are middle-class americans...people who just want to work hard and rely on jobs in the drilling industry. and what about the hypocrisy(虚伪，伪善), folks? does Peter Russo honestly have the gall(胆汁；五倍子；怨恨；苦味) to lecture us on the purity(洁净，纯净；纯洁，清白 ) of our rivers. when he has been polluting(污染，弄脏；玷污，败坏) himself with chemicals for years? he's not just been eating grass, he's been smoking it.

it's the only major bill he's sponsored in six years.

I know but they already have national coverage. what's the angle?

well, if it doesn't pass, I think he'll lose support from the shipbuilder's association.

so they lose support, it's not that juicy(多汁的，汁液丰富的；生动有趣的).

they're a huge part of his get-out-the-vote effort in Philly, 

It sounds like inside baseball(棒球；棒球运动).

not if I get the vote count, black and white numbers. nobody has that, but when I called the campaign, they stonewalled(拖延，阻碍；防守挡击) me. same thing in the whip's office. do you know anyone over there? in Underwood office.

no, I don't.

nobody on staff.

I just figured(（以重要地位）出现；<美，非正式>认为，估计；理解，弄懂；计算；用图画（或图形等）描绘，想象) because you gave me the Russo profile.

no, that didn't come fron them.

but Underwood organized the campaign.

I'm sorry, I don't know anybody there.

okay.

hey, it's me. I just wanted to fill you in on something. I should be back home at 10:00. meet me there.

Sarah made this one. it's a frog. and I made this one. can you guess what it is?

a lobster(龙虾；（食用）龙虾肉；<澳，新西兰>小龙虾)?

no, it's a scorpion(蝎子；蝎尾鞭；心黑的人). they're for you, for the ones you gave us.

am. they're beautiful.

but maybe you should bring them to school, for show and tell? or give them to your friends.

no, the other kids will just make fun of us.

why?

everybody hates us at school. they say dad's a crachhead(瘾君子) and that we're crack(破裂，裂开；崩溃) babies. I looked up 'Crack Baby' on the computer, I don't look like that.

yeah, they say dad's gonna OD like Amy Winehouse.

well, you told them that your dad doesn't do that kind of thing anymore, right?

yeah, we do, but they don't believe us.

did you try going to the teachers?

we can't do that, everyone will just hate us even more.

well, you can't worry about what other people think, right?

I wish dad wasn't running for Governor.

you ever been to Allentown before? I have not.

what do you think?

compared to new york, the parking is easier.

finding a decent(像样的，尚好的；得体的) bagel(百吉饼（硬面包圈）；（体育比赛中）零蛋), not so much.

we make up for it with the cream cheese.

shall we?

ready when you are.

your wastershed bill, you've ticked(（钟或其他机械装置）发出滴答声；<英>打钩，做记号；进展) off the republicans, oil, gas...

sometimes you gotta upset a few people to do the right thing.

not just a few. there's a sizable coalition(联合政府；联合体，联盟；联合，结合) that wants to see your bill fail. including enviroonmentalists from your own party.

don't think the bill enough.

we wanted a passable bill. that's why we aimed for middle ground...

do you actually care about the Delaware river?

I don't sponsor legislation I don't care about.

until recently, you hadn't sponsored any legislation at all.

I spent my time in congress focusing on things that were important to my constituents(选民；成分，构成要素；委托人).

the shipyard.

kept it open as long as I could.

okay, that's one thing, what are the others?

I'd love to provide you a list of all the things I've done in congress, but we've got 15 minutes...

your opponent(对手，竞争者；反对者，阻止者) has linked your inactivity to your fondness(爱好；溺爱) for single-malts(麦芽；麦芽酒).

I've been very open about my past. and I've done everything I can to overcome it. in a responsible, permanent way, and I preferred vodka to scotch. you should get your facts straight(直的，笔直的；端正的).

is your watershed act just a ploy to jump into the spotlight and pad(填塞，垫衬) your transcript(文字记录，抄本，文字本；<美>成绩单；（生化）转录本，转录物) while you apply for Governor school?

it's real money. it's real jobs, and when the Delaware river is less polutted than it's been in 50 years. it's holding up a real glass of its water and seeing how clear it is. that's what my bus tour is about.

the vice president is joining you later?

correct.

why has it taken him this long to endorse(（公开）赞同，认可; （尤指在支票背面）签名，背书) you?

he didn't think I was worth it. but then he heard I had a ont-on-one with the new york times and boom, he was on board.

I might print that.

the more of my words, the fewer of yours. the better off we'll both be.

if I didn't think you were such a liability(责任，义务；惹麻烦的人（或事）；负债，债务) to yourself, congressman, I might even like you.

if your circulation(发行量，销售量；血液循环；流传) was as high as the wall street journal, I might like you back. hit me, next question.

I have to put up a fight, Frank. 

tell them they're wasting their money. it's gonna pass.

are you sure?

when was the last time I got a count wrong.

if you were certain. you wouldn't be trying to neutralize(使失效，抵消；中和，使成为中性；使中立；击毁，摧毁) us.

well, Sancrop has been good to me. I'm just trying to do you and them a favor, Remy.

then why propose the legislation in the first place? you must've known they would oppose(反抗，阻碍；与……竞争，与……角逐) it.

The regulatory(管理的，控制的，监管的) restrictions(限制；限制条件) are minimal(极小的，极少的；极简抽象艺术的).

There's a bigger battle here, Frank.

Sancorp is against any step toward regulation(规章制度，规则；（运用规则条例的）管理，控制), no matter how small. Russo's planted his feet on the wrong side of the fence(篱笆，栅栏，围栏).

How much are you giving his opponent(对手，竞争者；反对者，阻止者)?

Check the F.E.C. filings(存档，归档；存档档案，归档记录；锉屑；（法院的）立案).

How much are you actually giving?

This is a ten billion dollar industry, Frank. There's money to spend.

If the democrats lose Pennsylvania, you know what that means.

We don't want you to lose leadership, but that's up to you, not us.

You don't have the same kind of relationship with the republicans that you have with me.

Then we'll adapt(适应；调整，使适合；改编；改造，改装).

We both have votes to count. Good luck.

You tell Sancorp they're being foolish.

I'm not gonna do that.

Well, then, you're being foolish.

Come on, Frank. Let's not make this personal.

I can't compete with Sancorp's war chest(胸部，胸膛；箱子，盒子，柜子；<英>金库，钱库). My only option is asymmetrical(非对称的；不匀称的，不对等的) to pick off the opposition one by one, like a sniper(狙击手) in the woods. There will come a time to put Remy in my crosshairs(十字准线；瞄准器), but not right now. As we used to say in Gaffney, never slap(打，拍；拍打，拍击；（尤指生气地）啪的一声放下，随意扔放；（快速地、随意地或用力地）涂抹（某物）；甩击；侮辱) a man while he's chewing(咀嚼，嚼碎；（为了品尝或因紧张而）不停地嚼，咬) tobacco.

Congressman, how are you?

I deeply appreciate you taking the time out of your schedule...

Hank, I need to eat. See if you can muster(寻求，聚集（支持、勇气等）；召集) up a club sandwich, extra bacon(培根，烟熏咸肉片).

Fuck me.

Thai cuisine(烹饪，风味；饭菜，菜肴) again.

The green curry(咖喱菜肴；咖喱粉) is for you, and the other green curry is for me.

I was actually just on my way out.

I bought you dinner. You have to eat it.

Or at the very least, you have to watch me eat mine.

I'm gonna be late to meet someone.

Who? Like a date? A friend.

Oh, the mysterious(不可思议的，难以理解的；（人）神秘的) fuck-buddy who you get all of your stories from? Lighten up. I was just teasing(取笑，嘲笑；逗弄（动物）；（尤指性方面）挑逗). Not that I would judge. We've all done it. I used to suck(吸，吮，啜；含在嘴里吸食；抽), screw(用螺丝固定；拧紧，旋紧；（物体）旋上), and jerk(急拉，猛推；（举重）挺举过头；制肉干) anything that moved just to get a story.

Really? Like who?

You want dish(说……的闲话；把（食物）装盘)?

No. It's just...

The com director(导演；管理者，负责人；董事，理事) on Ben Schroeder's senate race. A staffer in the Defense Department. My very own White House intern(<美>实习医生；<美>实习生). He was a real blabbermouth(长舌者) when he wasn't eating me out. And I even had a fling(短暂的风流韵事；一阵尽情的欢乐) with a congressman.

Which one?

You tell me yours, and I'll tell you mine.

I've never been with any.

Oh, come on. You're hot.

You're telling me that none of them have come on to you?

I haven't really been in those circles.

You are now.

I guess I don't really give off that vibe(<非正式>感应，氛围).

Oh, you mean the slut(荡妇；懒妇；母狗) vibe?

Look, I don't do that shit anymore. Cause once word got out, it was like I hit a wall, and nobody took me seriously. So, a piece of advice as far as career strategies(策略，战略) go: It's not worth fucking your way to the middle.

Chopsticks(筷子) or fork? Look, if you go, I am gonna have to eat both of these, and that's not cool.

No. I'll eat with you.

Good.

I don't do waiting , Back home, Meechum.

Sir.

Francis, How's your hand?

Fine.

You should change the bandage(绷带), uh?

Later.

I thought you were gonna be out late.

No.

You seem upset. I'm not.

What happened? 

Nothing.

Can I get more than two words out of you?

I'm just trying to relax.

Claire, I love you.

I love you too.

Did Zoe expect me to twiddle(旋弄；抚弄；玩弄；捻起来) my thumbs(拇指；（手套的）拇指部分) until her arrival? Perhaps she's making the mistake, thinking her time is as valuable as mine.

Proximity(（时间、空间、关系的）靠近，亲近) to power deludes(欺骗，哄骗；<旧>迷惑；<旧>逃避；<旧>使失望) some into believing they wield(挥，操，使用（武器、工具等）；运用（权力），施加) it. I put an end to that sort of thinking before it begins.

And if I'm not mistaken, the last time I was in Tannersville, Buddy Corcharan pulled me aside(在旁边，到（或向）一边；积攒) and told me I was wasting my time, because the Republicans were gonna sweep(打扫，清除；（目光）扫视) Monroe County in a landslide(山崩；大胜利). Well, Buddy had to eat his hat and both his shoes, when I won the county in a landslide. And let me tell you, that man has big feet and an even bigger head, so that was quite a meal. My daddy used to tell me a story about people who count their chickens before they hatched(孵化，孵出；密谋，策划). Although, to be fair, he probably didn't know what he was talking about, because he grew up in Pittsburgh. And I certainly never saw a hen(母鸡；雌禽) around my house,  unless you count my mother.

Do you want me to do something? But, let him talk.

I do love this town...

I don't know if he's ever going to introduce you.

He will. Just give him time.

Because it still has that frontier(边境，国界；(常sing.) 西部边疆，边远地区) spirit(精神，心灵；情绪，心境).

It's been an hour.

We were supposed to leave for Carbondale ten minutes ago.

I can't interrupt him. He's the Vice President.

We're not on the edge of Penn's Woods.

We need economic development flowcharts for the watershed bill sent over to Terry Womack's office.

Hard copies, 20 of them. 

I'll do it right away.

How's everything going with Rachel?

I think she's a little down in the dumps(废物，垃圾场（dump 的复数）；忧郁). She got a waitressing job last week, and then they let her go.

Why? 

She wouldn't tell me. All she said was her boss was a creep(讨厌的人，献媚者).

Thirty minutes ago, I received a text from Zoe. She intends(打算，想要；意指，意思是；准备，预留) to apologize, no doubt. I respect that she wants to atone(赎罪；弥补；偿还) in person, even though it's taken her over 16 hours to build up the courage.

Janine Skorsky is digging(搜寻，寻找；<非正式，旧>喜欢；挖，掘) into Peter Russo.

What in particular?

The shipbuilders' association.

She have an angle?

The watershed bill is a consolation(安慰，起安慰作用的人（物）) prize for them losing their jobs.

That's not an unfair assessment(评估，评价；估价，估计).

She thinks if the bill fails to pass, they'll withdraw(提，取（银行账户中的钱款）；停止提供，不再给予) support.

Not an unfair speculation(投机，投机买卖；猜测，推测，推断).

Well, I know how hard you've been working on his campaign, so I wanted to give you a heads-up.(提个醒)

Well, let me know if she expands her inquiry(询问，疑问；调查，审查； 探查，探询).

Into what? 

Anything you deem(认为，相信) worth telling.

well, can I throw her a bone? She might be more talkative if I have information for her.

What sort of bone? 

The vote count for the bill.

I don't have a vote count yet. Should have a preliminary(初步行动，准备工作；预赛，预试) one this afternoon.

you'll let me know?

as soon as I have something solid(立体图形，立方体；固体；固体食物；（液体中的）固形物).

there's one more thing. about last night.

oh, no need to apologize. I'm sure you had a very good reason.

I do. I think we should end it. not professionally(专业地；内行地), the other thing.

why now?

we have a really good working relationship. I don't wanna a overcomplicate(使变得过分复杂) that.

all right.

you're okay with it?

completely. it's over.

and it won't change things in terms of our arrangement?

Oh, please. I don't punish(处罚，惩罚) people for making adult decisions.

Thank you, Francis.

She was never more than a faint(模糊的，微弱的；微小的，可能性不大的) blip(在雷达屏幕显示出的）物体光点) on my radar. We've served each other's purpose, If she wants to be an adult, let her see how she can fly once she leaves the nest(窝，巢，穴；舒适的居所)

Claire. 

Catherine.
 
Thank you for fitting me in.

Oh, I can always find time for you and Frank.

Well, the reason I'm here is the C.W.I. has a large shipment(运输，运送；运输的货物，装载的货物量) of water filters stuck(被困住，陷入困境) in South Sudan, and they've been in storage for the past four months, just sitting there, and the Sudanese government.

Won't release the shipments through customs, My deputy(代理人，副手，副职；代表，议员) briefed me on the latest

Right. And I know that Francis spoke to you about this not too long ago, but lately we haven't heard much from the state department, so I was wondering if you could help.

We've done our best, Claire, I put my top people on this The Sudanese are just not responding.

Well, is there anything else we can do? There's over $200,000 worth of equipment

I wish I could. I know how important this is to you, but we're about to cut off diplomatic(外交的，从事外交的；有手腕的，灵活变通的) ties(领带，领结；（绑扎东西用的）带子，绳子；纽带，联系), It's a directive(指示；指令) straight(直的，笔直的) from the President. We can't ignore their human rights violations(违反，妨碍；违规或不雅行为) anymore.

What about back channels?

Well, once we cut ties, I can't contact their government officially or unofficially.

Well, is there someone you could put me in touch with?

I'm sorry, Claire. My hands are tied. I would move mountains for you and Frank, but I've done all I can

Of course.

Okay. Good to see you. 

You too.

Congressman, you have a major bill going to the floor later this week. Are you optimistic(乐观的，乐观主义的；（估计）过于乐观的，高估的) it'll pass? 

I'm very optimistic. The Delaware river watershed Act not only protects large portions(一部分；（尤指餐馆中食物的）一份，一客) of the state's freshwater resources, it also creates thousands of jobs. I'm confident that my colleagues on the Hill

There's only one way to create jobs I did it during my administration, The answer is tax credits for small businesses. You've got to encourage self starting entrepreneurs(企业家) to start new ventures(风险项目，冒险事业；冒险旅行，冒险行动), hire employees. 

But specifically, about the watershed act... 

Small businesses, that's the solution. Everything else is window dressing, Thank you all very much.

Thank you.

Good night, Mr. VicePresident

Hello.

I need to talk about Matthews.

Yes. I read the press reports. He's not being very helpful, is he?

He's doing more harm(伤害，损害) than good.

I want to ask him to leave.

Well, that wouldn't make for a very good story.

It's better than him torpedoing(用鱼雷袭击；彻底破坏，完全摧毁) the whole bus tour.

Have you tried to talk to him?

No, I wanted to ask your advice first.

Well, maybe there's a way to keep him on the tour and inspire(激励，鼓舞；赋予灵感，激发（想法) his support.

We have fundamentally(根本地，基础地；（用来加强语气）从根本上说) different views.

Well, look, you're not going to be able change his ideology(意识形态，思想体系；<古>观念学；<古>空想), but dig deeper. Jim is a proud man. Tap into that pride.

I just wish he was gone.

Well, you do whatever you think best. But whatever it is you decide, be firm(结实的，坚硬的；牢固的，稳固的) and stand up for yourself. He'll respond to that at least. And call me back if you need anything.

What was the reason he gave you? Were you messing up?

No. The head waiter said I was doing a really good job.

He even started letting me take my own tables on the second day.

And then the manager... what's his name?

Leon.

He propositioned(向（某人）提议；（尤指冒犯地）提出与……性交，向……求欢) you?

Called me into his office,  said couldn't afford to start taking anyone new on, even parttime. Put his hand on my knee, said he might be able to make an exception. So he started sliding his hand up my thigh. So I stood up and I tell him I should get back to work. He says, "Stay." He unbuckled(解开) his belt(腰带，皮带；传送带；地带).

Did you?

No, I walked out of the office and got back to my tables. Next day, I came into work, told me to go home. I was fired.

Tell me the name of the restaurant.

You're home early. I needed a breather. I didn't have breakfast this morning. I might head back in a little while.

The vote count?

It's going to come down to the wire(给……接上电线，接通（电源）；（用电线）接通，连接；电汇) on this one.

I spoke to Catherine Durant today. She's unable to get the shipment out of South Sudan.

Yeah, we're cutting all diplomatic ties. Foreign Affairs is up in arms about it.

Yes. Which is why she can't lift a finger, according to her. It's what she said anyway. Anyway, I need you to talk to her.

I don't think that would make any difference.

I thought she owed us, Francis.

She does, but there's limits. She's Secretary of State. She can't break diplomatic protocol.

Well, can you make some calls?

If she can't, I can't. Plus(而且；加上) I have to focus on the watershed bill.

I'm taking time out of my schedule to help you with that.

Because you drafted it. 

Because you asked me. I didn't want to do this. All I'm asking is that you give me a little bit of your time in return.

And how am I supposed to fix a problem I can't fix?

What about Remy? Glendon Hill must have contacts in South Sudan.

He's fighting us on the vote.

Those are two completely separate issues.

They are not. He does you a favor, he hangs(悬挂，吊；（使）挂在墙上) it over me.

So what you're saying is my goals are secondary to yours.

That is not what I'm saying.

I think you don't want to go hat in hand to somebody who used to work for you.

I will not be lectured(（尤指在大学里）开讲座，讲课；训斥，告诫) to the moment you walk in the door!

I called Catherine, as promised! Her inability to deliver is not my problem or my fault! I cannot control changing global landscapes(风景；风景地貌)! And I will not be cornered into making promises I cannot deliver! I am sorry I yelled(叫喊，号叫，叫着说). I'm under a lot of pressure.

You're right, I didn't think it through.

I just can't go to Remy right now. He's poaching(偷猎；挖走（人员）；窃取，盗用) too many of my people. I've got two congressmen who will not commit. I was hoping you might speak to them.

Who?

Vanderburgh and Abrams.

What is it that you want me to say to them? They're big on the environment. They don't think the bill goes far enough. They respect your opinion. I wanted you to walk them through the bill stepbystep. Put them at ease. I need to get them in the yes column. I meet with them tomorrow. I'll deliver the bruises(挫伤).

You meet with them later and patch(补丁，补片) them up. That might just do the trick(花招，诡计，骗局；窍门，技巧).

Of course.

I think I broke the bowl(碗，盆；一碗之量).

We have contacts there through our oil interest.

I'm going to need government intervention(干预，介入；调停，斡旋).

Wherever there's a government, we know people.

Even when there's only the illusion(错觉，幻觉；幻想，错误的观念) of a government.

Will you help me?

I'd like to.

But for something like this, I'm afraid there's a price tag.

The C.W.I. will endorse(签名，背书) Sancorp as ecofriendly(环境友好型的，环保的). They can use our logo on any PR or marketing materials you want.

We'll need more than that.

They were willing to donate over a million for that. These filters are only worth $200,000.

I'd say that's a bargain(便宜货，减价品；协议，交易).

You turned down that offer. Landscape(风景，景色；形势，情形) has shifted(移动，（使）转移) since then.

The watershed bill? 

That's right.

You want it amended(修改，修订；纠正，改正)?

I want you to kill it, the whole thing.

C.W.I. has publicly backed the bill, Remy.

What you do publicly is your concern.

Gentlemen. Please, have a seat. So have either of you changed your mind since we last spoke?

We're still undecided, Frank.

Leaning(（身体）倾斜；倾向于做；倚靠，靠在) one way or the other?

If congress is going to allocate a quarter billion dollars, sure it goes towards a bill that does more to protect the...

we've been through all that. I know your concerns(担心，忧虑).

So if the protection standards don't change, we would rather see that money spent more effectively elsewhere.

That sounds like you're both leaning no.

We've been very clear about what we're asking.

Okay.

This is you, Abrams. And this is you, Vanderburgh. And over here is the majority of the Democratic caucus. See, you're over there all by your lonesome. Now, you don't mind being the black sheep. You're the liberal wing of the liberal wing. Most of the time you can vote what you want, we still pass things anyway. But this time it does matter. And what the two of you aren't taking into account is between this end of the desk and this end of the desk, is me. Now, I'm going to say to you what I say to every congressman that sits where you're sitting now. Vote your district. Vote your conscience(良知，良心；内疚，愧疚). Don't surprise me. And the most important one of those is don't surprise me. Now, you're both to meet with my wife tomorrow. And you're to hear her out, She will go through your concerns point-by-point. And I am certain after that that the two of you will make the right decision, This is the part where you leave.

I have often found that bleeding hearts have a ironic(反语的，讽刺的；（因出乎意料而）奇怪的，好笑的) fear of their own blood. One drop and they seize(抓住，捉住；（用武力）夺取，占领) up. But offer them a caring hand and massage(按摩，推拿) them back to life and they soon start beating to the right drum(不停地击打；击鼓，打鼓).

Hello.

I've just spoken to Abrams and Vanderburgh. Let them toss and turn tonight, but they're all yours tomorrow.

I'll reach out to their offices and set a time.

Thank you, Claire.

Of course. Whatever I can do to help.

Here you go, sir. Enjoy.

Excuse me.

There's a hair on my steak(肉排，（尤指）牛排；鱼排，鱼块).

I am so sorry, sir. Where?

Right there.

I don't see it.

Are you telling me I'm blind?

No, sir. I'm so sorry. I'll have the kitchen... What's your name?

Stephanie.

You can leave the plate, Stephanie. I'd like to talk to the manager.

Yes, sir. I'll go get him.

Thank you.

Good evening, sir.

Uh, Stephanie tells me there was a hair on your plate.

No.

There wasn't any hair.

Leon, right? That's your name?

Yes.

Stephanie is a hot little number, isn't she? Nice ass(傻瓜，笨蛋；屁股，臀部；<旧>驴；性感的人). Did you make her blow you before or after you hired her?

Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

Sit down, Leon. Sir, I want you to go.

I said sit. 

Don't make me call the police.

I'll tell you what. You call the police,

I'll call the department of immigration(移民（入境）；移民人数；移民局入境检查，移民局入境检查处) about the four undocumented employees you have working in the kitchen.

Felony(重罪), Leon. And I might also mention your girlfriend, her mother, and her aunt who also undocumented and living in an apartment that you pay for. Prison time for you, deportation(驱逐出境) for them. Not a pretty picture, is it? Let's talk about Rachel Posner.

How close is it?

I should have the last two votes I need committed today.

I just want to make sure no one changes their mind.

I'd prefer not to get embroiled(使卷入；使混乱) in environmental issues at this time.

But it's also a jobs-creation package.

It's antagonizing(使……敌对；使……对抗；对……起反作用) oil and gas. We can't afford that sort of battle after all the capital(资本，资金；资本家，资方；首都) we spent on education.

All I need is one public statement of support.

I won't do that. How about you take Linda tomorrow? You set her up in your offices.

Any meetings or calls you might need to whip up votes, you got her there.

Well, I can't afford to spend a whole day lobbying on the Hill.

Well, you got deputies.

Yes, I do.

Well, you're telling me you can't manage them from ten blocks away?

Of course I can, sir.

Look, if it's too difficult... 

No, no, no. We'll help you out, Frank.

Won't we, Linda?

Yes. If you'll just excuse me, I have a few things to rearrange on my schedule.

What else, Frank? Tell me what Birch is up to.

No, I know I've already canceled twice. They start next week. Sweetie, I'm trying to figure this out.

Linda. Excuse me.

Yes? 

Just wanted thank you for agreeing to pitch(投，掷，扔；（棒球中）投（球）；触地) in, I know you have a full plate.

Of course, Frank.

Is everything all right? It sounds like...

yes, what time do you want me to come by tomorrow?

Can we talk?

Can I just call you back in one second? I will call you. Yes.

Linda, I am so sorry that the president has forced you into this. It was not my intention. If you would like, I can talk to congress...

no, it's not that,  It's... It's a personal matter. Don't worry.

Well, what is it? Maybe I can help.

Just... my son didn't get into Stanford. I was supposed to meet with the Provost(教务长；院长；监狱看守) tomorrow to see if I could get him to change his mind. I asked the president if I could go, and he said yes, but he must have forgotten.

You should go. I'm sure the president will understand.

No, no. I don't let personal matters get in the way of my job, Frank.

Linda, you can't put your entire life on hold. And certainly not at the expense(代价，费用；业务费用) of your own son.

Well, it has been at the expense of my son. It's my fault he didn't get in. I was on the campaign and I wasn't there for him. His grades suffered. His application was... But I figured(（以重要地位）出现；<美，非正式>认为，估计；理解) if I could just meet with the Provost face to face...

ok, look, you're going to Stanford tomorrow. If you show up at my office, I won't let you in, so don't even consider it.

Frank, the president wants me to be...

he doesn't have to know. I'm going to have one of my schedulers buy you a ticket. The bill will be fine.

Frank. You don't have to do this.

We may have our disagreements, Linda, but that doesn't mean we can't look out for each other. You tell them you're coming.

Test, test, test.

All right, Zoe. This is Dave, the senior producer in New York. We'll go live in four minutes. 

Sounds good.

The first topic will be the congressional agenda for the fall session, then we'll move on to the midterms(中期；期中考试), then we'll wrap(包，裹，包装) it up with Peter Russo's race for Governor and his watershed bill.

Okay, great.

Taking you off mic until 30 out.

Hey, Janine, I have to talk about the watershed bill.

Do you have a one-sheet?(提纲) 

Uh, yeah. Hold on.

Thanks.

Any word on the vote count?

Still no luck. I've called every democrat in the house to cobble(修，拙劣地修补；草率地拼凑) together a number, but no one's getting back to me.

So what can I say?

That there's a lot in flux(不断变化，波动), and it'll be tight(紧身的，紧贴的；拉紧的).

Okay. Thanks.

Yeah. Sure thing.

Hey, Francis, it's me. Call me back.

Yes.
    
Congressman Russo. He says it's urgent.

Fine.

Good morning, sir.

I'd like to talk about how the tour's going.

Well, let's talk on the bus. Don't we have an event at 11:00?

There won't be any events until we talk.

You're hijacking(抢劫，劫持；强行控制，操纵) the microphone. You're contradicting(反驳，否认；相抵触，相矛盾；发生矛盾) everything I say. We need to be promoting(促进，提倡；升职，晋升；促销) the watershed act.

Well, I appreciate your being so forthright(直率的；直截了当的). Let me tell you what I don't appreciate. The D.N.C. is running a man with zero track record, except for(除了……以外) substance(毒品) abuse(滥用), to fill my shoes.

I realize you don't want to be here, sir, but it seems like you're deliberately(故意地；从容不迫地，小心翼翼地) trying to sabotage(蓄意破坏，故意毁坏；妨碍，捣乱，阻挠) my campaign.

Despite my better judgment, I'm trying to save it. I know the people of this state better than you, Peter. They don't want to hear about watersheds. They want to hear about jobs.

Well, this week, they need to hear both.

Well, then, maybe I should just stand quietly beside you at the podium(讲台，乐队指挥台) and watch you lose.

You don't think I can win, do you? 

I'm not optimistic(乐观的，乐观主义的；（估计）过于乐观的，高估的). 

You lost the first two times you ran for Governor. The third time, nobody thought you had a chance. By September, you were 15 points down. You were out of money. You had to mortgage(按揭，抵押贷款；抵押贷款额) your own house just to keep your staff on payroll(工资名单).

I'm well aware(知道的，明白的；察觉到的，意识到的；有……意识的，有……知识的) of what I did. I was there.

My point is you kept going. You hit 67 counties in less than 20 days, and you proved everyone wrong. Like it or not, it's my name on the ticket this time, and I got the shot, and I'm gonna prove everyone wrong. Just like you did. Including you, sir. I would like your support, but if you won't give it, fine. It won't stop me.

You think it's easy for me to be here?

I left the Governor's mansion(大厦，宅邸；<英>公寓楼) right in my prime(盛年，壮年时期；质数). To be what? Vice president. I thought that was a step up. But you know what? I don't have a fucking shred(细条，碎片；极少量) of real influence. I'm trotted(快步，疾走；步行，走) around like a goddamn(该死的；讨厌的；受诅咒的) mascot(吉祥物，福神), and this is my home state.

I'm offering you influence, sir. I'd like your guidance and your expertise(专长，专门技能（知识）；专家的意见). But if that's not on the table, then, well...with all due(到期的，预期的；应有的，应得的；应付的，应给的；适当的) respect, Mr. Vice President, you should head back to Washington.

Your husband was very explicit(清楚明白的，明确的，详述的；直截了当的，坦率的；赤裸裸表现性爱（或暴力）的，露骨的). I would categorize(将……分类，把……列作) it as a threat.

What did he say exactly? 

Not to surprise him.

Didn't he also tell you to vote your district and your conscience?

He did, but those seemed far lower on his priority list.

Well, he would never fault(挑剔，指责；发球失误；产生断层) you if you had a compelling(强迫，迫使；使发生，促使) reason to do what you think is right.

I'm confused. Aren't you for this bill?

C.W.I. Is publicly for it. Privately, I have my doubts for the same reasons you do.

I was under the impression(印象，感想；影响，作用；印象画) that we were here so you could persuade(说服，劝服；使相信，使信服；（情形，事件）驱使，敦促) us to vote yes.

Oh, I'm not trying to persuade you of anything. I will say this: if the bill fails, it's not the end of the world. We can always sponsor new legislation. You know, something with stricter regulatory standards.

Just to be clear, you're telling us you don't mind if we vote against the bill.

I'm simply saying what my husband would that you should vote your conscience.

How are we looking? 

We're short a vote.

I just got off the phone with Claire.

Vanderburgh and Abrams are on board.

Those are definite yeses? 

Definite. We should be good.

Yes? I've been trying to reach you since yesterday.

Well, I've been a bit busy counting votes.

You said you'd have a number for me.

Well, you should try my press office.

I did. They won't return my calls.

Well, the official word is it will be close.

I'm trying to get the unofficial word.

Oh, I can't appear to be playing favorites now, can I?

This isn't because of the other day, is it?

What other day?

You said we'd keep our professional relationship.

Well, this is what professional feels like.

The vice president of the United States, Jim Matthews!

Thank you.

It's good to be back in Bristol.

Go, warriors(战士)! Now, you all know me. I'm a windbag(风囊；饶舌之人). I can go on until you all fall asleep, get eight hours of shut-eye, and wake up to find me still yapping(（小狗）狂吠，乱叫；（非正式）哇哩哇啦地说). And there's a lot I could say about this young man to my left. The truth is, I've had a lot of doubts about him and his ideas, about his past, about his youth. But if you'll remember, a lot of you had doubts about me the first time I ran. And the second and the third. But over the last few days, traveling around the state with Peter, I have to admit he's won me over. He's smart, he's energetic(精力充沛的，充满活力的；积极的；（活动）剧烈的，费力气的；高能的), and, most important, he's a fighter. Now, it says "A fresh start" On that bus over there. And that's the real truth, because this young man will give our state the fresh start it so desperately needs. Ladies and gentlemen, the next Governor of Pennsylvania, Peter Russo.

Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

How's it going, Bristol? Today I'd like to talk to you about economic recovery. Now, as many of you may be aware(意识到；了解；省悟), mostly because my opponent feels the need to spend millions of dollars on TV ads about my past, I know a thing or two about recovery(康复，痊愈；戒除；恢复). I've learned a great deal through my personal struggles(奋斗，努力；搏斗，扭打). I've learned how to harness(控制并利用) my strength(体力，力量；实力，影响力) and my resolve(解决（问题或困难）；决定，下定决心), make them work for me, much the way your Bristol watermills(水磨，水力磨粉机) harnessed(治理，利用) the power of your beautiful Otter(水獭；水獭皮；浮钩具) Creek(小溪；小湾) and the mighty(强大的，巨大的) Delaware river years ago. Let me tell you how the Delaware river will reinvigorate(使再振作，使复兴) your economy for years to come! 

We're going to get the shipment out of Sudan.

That's great. 

It might take a few weeks, but I think you should start making arrangements for Botswana,where you're gonna set up base camp and the depot(仓库，库房). Just send me a budget as soon as you've got one. 

Claire, is there any way we can send someone in my place?

I thought you wanted to be on the ground.

I would, but I can't this time.

Why not?

I wasn't sure how to tell you this, but I passed the 12-week mark.(怀孕12周)

You're expecting. Gillian, that's wonderful. That...

When did this happen? Who's the father?

There was this guy I met overseas. Doctors without borders. We had this thing. Then I left. But he came back to the states a few months ago, and that's when it happened. Anyway, it didn't end well. But I want to keep the baby. 

And does he know? 

He's married. I shouldn't have. It was stupid.

You don't have to explain.

I'll need some time off at the beginning of march.

Of course.

And absolutely, we'll send someone else instead.

I appreciate it, Claire.

Sure.
 
You said medium rare?（三分熟）

Just, uh, let me know if you guys need anything.

Who would you guess texted me just now? I thought she'd last more than a couple days.

Going somewhere? 

Just for an hour or two.

I got one last holdout(坚持，抵抗) to whip.

What's the vote count on Russo's bill?

Oh, don't you wanna shower first before we dirty ourselves with business?

I'll shower after you leave.

What's the vote count?

Your tone doesn't inspire(激励，鼓舞；赋予灵感，激发) me to be very forthcoming(即将发生的；乐于提供信息的，愿意提供帮助的).

Oh, the fuck wasn't enough? You need a special tone too?

Ooh, someone washed her mouth out with acid(酸；<非正式>迷幻药；尖刻) this morning. Whatever it is you're grappling(扭打，搏斗；努力解决问题) with, I am sincerely(由衷地，真诚地) not interested.

You're almost twice my age.

You said that didn't bother you.

I lied.

If you had a daughter, she'd be older than me.

In 20 years, I'll still be younger than you are now.

Well, I can't argue with basic arithmetic(算术；演算).

You don't find that disgusting(反感，憎恶；厌恶，憎恶)?

I think you want me to.

But I've never considered this any more or less than a transaction between two consenting(许可，允许；同意) adults.

If you just want the girl who will do your bidding(出价，喊价；投标) for you, you already have that.

Why do you need to fuck me?
 
I would remind you that it was you who initiated(开始实施，发起；使了解) our affair(公共事务，政治事务；事情), and it was you who came knocking at my door last winter.

And it was me who asked that we stop what we're doing now.

Which I respected until you picked up a phone and asked me to come over tonight.

Because you wouldn't give me what I wanted unless I did.

So tell me, why do you need this?

You don't seem to get any pleasure out of it. I know I certainly don't.

I seem(似乎，看来) to always leave you satisfied(使满意；满足（要求、需要等）).

How do you know I'm not faking it?

Are you?

Doesn't it say a lot that you can't tell?

What do you think about when I'm up against the wall?

A great man once said that everything in life is about sex. Except sex. Sex is about power.

So you need a whore(娼妓，妓女), which makes you a pimp(皮条客；男妓).

I'm not a pimp. Just a very generous(慷慨的，大方的；大量的) John(<美，非正式>厕所；<美，非正式>嫖客).

Fine. As long as we're clear about what this is, I can play the whore. Now pay me.

The bill will pass. We have it by two votes. You can pass that along to your friend, miss Skorsky.

If she must say such things in order to sleep at night, so be it. Her loyalty(忠诚，忠贞；忠于……的强烈情感) costs me nothing but the occasional(偶尔的，不经常的) crumb(点滴，少许；面包心) of news.

Her hatefulness takes no toll(（道路、桥梁等的）通行费；<美>长途电话费) at all.

You don't compensate(赔偿，偿付；弥补，补偿；抵消；酬报（某人）) a working girl so you can cuddle(搂抱，拥抱；紧靠…而坐(或躺)) after.

Final voting...

A lot of small towns, some really great crowds.

No buses losing their brakes(刹车，车闸；阻碍).

Oh, please now. 

When do you head back?

Tomorrow. We wanna do a press conference when all the votes are in.

Members, please cast your votes now. 

Are you all right?

I'm just a little nauseous(令人作呕的；厌恶的). It'll pass. I'm okay.

You said you're due(到期的，预期的；应有的) in March? 

March 14th.

It's so exciting. How's the morning sickness?

I think I'm over the hump(小圆丘，岗，隆起；驼峰). I have to pee(撒尿，小便) all the time. Weird(奇怪的，不寻常的；怪异的，超自然的) cravings(雕刻，雕刻品；雕刻术).

It was good to be on the road again. Invigorating(鼓舞；使精力充沛).

Our internals are showing a nice bump(碰上，撞上；（无意地）碰，撞) in the numbers.

You made a big difference.

The president is grateful, and so am I.

Well, it's a team effort, right?

Excuse me. I have yet to say hello to your better half.

How'd it go at Stanford? 

Well, I think. The Dean's(院长；系主任；教务长；主持牧师) a republican, so there was not a lot of small talk. But he seemed open to considering it. We'll know more next week.

That's terrific(极好的，了不起的；极大的，惊人的). 

I appreciate your helping me out.

Oh, I didn't do anything. Anybody can book a plane ticket.

That's not true. You covered for me.

Well, we have to keep the important things in perspective(（观察问题的）视角，观点；透视（画）法), right?

Don't think it's bought you any favors.

Kindness isn't kindness if you expect a reward.

The man of the hour!

Not yet. The votes are still coming in.

Hey, how'd you vote? I voted yes.

Voting. I knew I forgot something.

We got this.

There's some sparkling(闪烁，闪耀；生气勃勃) grape juice there to celebrate.

30 seconds remaining. 30 seconds.

Looking good.

Come on, everyone. Let's go.

Everyone's voting along party lines.

See? This is what happens when we all stick together.

This is an easy win for us.

15 seconds.

Vote now. Ten seconds.

Come on.

This can't be happening.

Members, please cast(投射（光，影）；将（视线，目光）投向；浇铸（金属等）；分配角色) your votes now.

Voting is closed.

Hr 4913 is defeated(击败，战胜；困惑，难住).

Doug. 

I thought we had it.

So this means it's dead?

It's such a shame(羞耻，羞愧；羞耻心，羞耻感). All of that hard work.

I wanna know who lied.

### Chapter 10

The whole reason we do these meetings, Frank, is so I can get accurate(准确的，精确的) information from you.

I always said it was going to be close.

Then why did every article I read yesterday say the leadership was confident the bill would pass?

Do you know Janine Skorsky?

She used to be the Herald's White House correspondent.

I remember Janine.

She wrote an article for Slugline reporting a verified vote count. Once the media got ahold(抓，握) of that, it went everywhere.

I don't know where she got that number. Maybe she made it up.

It doesn't matter if she made it up. The democrats seem divided(使）分开，分散；分配，分担). The leadership looks incompetent(无能力的，不称职的).

But compared to the the budget and our education act, well, this was a minor bill, sir.

That happened to be in the national spotlight, which is what you wanted. 

I got the count wrong.

It rarely happens, but it happens.

What worries me is that the White House's influence isn't translating into support on the hill.

Linda's involvement had no effect?

I wouldn't say that that's the case, sir.

Did you sense(感觉官能（即视、听、嗅、味、触五觉）) any pushback, any fallout(核爆炸后的）放射性坠尘；（工业事故或生产过程中产生的）空气悬浮物；后果，余波) from the education battle?

Sir, the truth is I wasn't there.

I had to make a trip to California to meet the Provost of Stanford for my son. I told you about it last week.

It was my decision, sir. I made a judgment call that we could pass the bill without her help.

But, look, tight(紧身的，紧贴的；拉紧的，绷紧的；牢固的) votes like this, you can analyze them to death, but at the end of the day, we came up short. That's my fault, no one else's. Certainly not Linda's.

I shouldn't have gone. The meeting didn't even work.

I thought you said they were reconsidering.

No. I got an email this morning. They decided not to overturn the admissions(录取，录取人数；入场费) decision.

Oh, Christ. I'm sorry, Linda.

Not a great day so far. But I appreciate your covering for me in there.

There may be a way to turn Linda's bad luck into my good fortune. But first I must deal with treason(叛国罪，通敌罪) within the ranks(组织（或机构等）中的全体人员（ranks）). the two renegades(叛徒；变节者；脱党者) who voted against the bill. I have zero tolerance(忍受，容忍) for betrayal(背叛，出卖), which they will soon indelibly(难忘地；擦不掉地; 不能消灭地) learn.

I know why you lost the vote. Somebody got to Vanderburgh and Abrams.

Remy Danton.

Your wife.

I've got contacts on both their staffs.

There was a meeting between the three of them.

I know. I arranged it.

She told them to vote no. 

No, not true.

Sources on two different staffs saying the exact same thing?

That makes no sense(（对某物的）感觉；道理，合理性).

I'm not telling you what makes sense, I'm telling you facts. This is a juicy story, Francis. Carly will love it. The majority whip's wife stabs(刺，戳，捅) him in the back.

Be careful, Zoe.

I'm feeding you.

Now you have to feed me.

So give me something better.

Are you going to answer my question?

Did she or didn't she?

Tell me now, or so help me God, I will make it my mission in life to not only destroy your careers, but to obliterate(消灭，摧毁；涂抹，遮蔽；(从头脑中) 抹掉；盖销（尤指邮票）) all hope and happiness that you manage to cling(抓住，抱紧；黏附，粘住；依恋) to.

She said it would be okay. To back stab me?

To do what we thought was right.

So she did tell you to vote no.

She said it wouldn't be the end of the world if the bill failed.

Those were her exact words.

You discuss this with no one. Is that understood?

Do you blame yourself for not being in Washington to secure(（尤指经过努力而）获得，得到；使安全，保护) the votes?

A bill this size is a team effort. There are a lot of sponsors(赞助者，赞助商；（培训或教育的）资助者).

But you were the chief sponsor and the bill manager.

That's true.

So shouldn't you have been in Washington?

I'm running for Governor.

I have a commitment(忠诚，献身；承诺，保证) to the people of my state.

Are you aware that the Swofford campaign is putting out a new commercial(电视广告，电台广告) today that says, quote, "If Peter Russo can't follow through in congress, can he follow through with sobriety(清醒，冷静；节制；严肃)?"

That's all. Thank you very much.

Do you want to comment? Thanks, guys.

Congressman!

All I said was what you always say. to vote their conscience.

You encouraged them to defy(违抗，不服从；挑战) me.

I met with them. That's what you asked me...

no, that is not what you did. I specifically told you I needed them to vote yes on this bill. There was no room for interpretation(解释，理解；表演，演奏，艺术处理；口译). It's a deliberate(故意的，蓄意的；从容的) lie, so don't try to sugarcoat(裹以糖衣；粉饰，使有吸引力) it, Claire.

I needed Remy's help. You wouldn't offer any.

Oh, wait.

You did this for Remy?

No. For myself. To get my shipment out of Sudan. He provided assistance.

In exchange for defeating the bill. No. In exchange for not helping it succeed.

Which is the same goddamn thing. Do you realize you have endangered(使处于险境，危及) everything that we have been working toward? There was a timetable(时间表；时刻表；课程表) here, Claire. We needed strong momentum(冲力，推力；动力，势头；动量，冲量) right up until the last minute.

I can't operate based on plans you haven't shared with me.

Then you should've asked me first.

No, I'm not going to ask for your blessing on every decision I make, Francis.

We make decisions together.

Yeah, well, it hasn't felt like that. Not for the past six months. I don't feel as though I'm standing beside you.

Other people know, Claire. This could become a story about us. And that's something you do not recover from.

Who? 

That's something that follows you for life.

Who knows?

Zoe.

I thought you said she could be trusted.

What about our trust?

You can't control her, can you, Francis?
 
She wouldn't have been a problem if you hadn't lied.

No, she wouldn't have been a problem if you hadn't dropped your pants(<美> 裤子；<英> 内裤，短裤). And you come in here, to my office, and berate(严责；申斥) me when you're the one who's exposed(暴露，使显露) us?

Don't you try to turn this around on me.

I fired half of my staff for us. I have turned down donations for us. I drafted Peter's bill for us. I diverted(使转向，使绕道；分散，转移) time and energy away from my goals for us.

Okay, I don't wanna have to say this, but maybe you need to hear it. C.W.I. is important, yes, but it doesn't come close to what we are trying to accomplish. You must see that!

I'm just being honest.

Then be honest about how you've been using me just like you use everybody else.

That was never part of the bargain(便宜货，减价品；协议，交易).

Is it the hot flashes?

Get out. Get out.

I'll see you back at the house.

I'm on my way to the office. Let me call you when I get there.

No, no. We need to talk now.

I know you're upset, Peter, but that's not going to achieve(（经努力）达到，取得，实现；获得成功) anything.

I am more than upset, Frank.

Change your tone. I'm in no mood(心境，情绪；气氛，情感基调；心情不好).

I don't give a fuck! Goodbye, Peter.

You hang up on me now, you're not gonna appreciate who I call next.

Excuse me? 

I promised my people jobs. You promised me you could get this bill passed. You failed on your promise. I'm not gonna fail on mine. So however you need to fix it, you figure it out.(解决它) Otherwise, I go public with Kapeniak and the Kern editorial.

You need to cool down and think very carefully about what you just said.

You don't understand. I'm not afraid of you anymore, Frank.

Then you're misguided(误导；使误入歧途).

My past is out in the open. You don't hold that over my head anymore.

They don't know everything, Peter.

You destroy me, you destroy yourself. Fix it.

What do you want me to do? 

We have to accelerate(（使）加快，促进；（车辆或驾驶者）加速) things.

Isn't it too early?

It's almost two full months into the election.  That gives the White House too much time to vet somebody.

Peter's crossed the line. We built up his confidence, and now we're losing control of him.

Maybe he was just blowing off steam.(发脾气；放出多余的蒸汽)

No. He's determined(决定，控制；查明，确定；下定决心). We have to act now. You have everything you need on your end?

Give me a when and a where. Some sort of social setting's preferable(更好的，更合适的).

Anything else? 

I'll need cash. About three grand.

It'll be in your top drawer by tomorrow morning.

Sir...

Once we do this, we're committed.

Understood. 

I can't predict(预言，预计，预卜) how he's gonna react(（作出）反应；起化学反应； (对食物等）不良反应，过敏).

Well, I won't be blackmailed(勒索，敲诈；胁迫，威胁；勒索金).

Hello?

Zoe Barnes?

Yeah. Who is it?

Claire Underwood.

Zoe?

I apologize for not buzzing(发嗡嗡声，发蜂鸣声；匆忙走动).(没有按门铃)

Somebody was coming in the building when I was downstairs, so I just figured(（以重要地位）出现；<美，非正式>认为，估计；理解)...

this is nice... fire escape(逃跑，逃脱；逃避).

Hey, could you please not go through my things?

Oh, I'm sorry. Am I intruding(闯入；打扰，侵扰；（火成岩）侵入)?

Yeah, actually. You are.

Well, that makes it a two-way-street, I suppose.

Okay, if you... if you came here to punish me... Fine. I get it.

Such a shame(羞耻，羞愧；羞耻心), how naive(天真的，幼稚的；（艺术风格）朴素的，原始的) you are.

I'm not naive. 

No? I've known everything from the beginning, Zoe. My husband and I tell each other everything. Don't you believe me? Is there a spider I can trap(陷阱，网，夹子；圈套)?

I'm not here to punish you or to tell you to stop. I just thought I should open those big bright eyes.

I think you should leave.

I think I should too. Maybe you're not that naive. A lesser woman wouldn't have opened the door.

Union Station, please.

This is Claire. I'm unavailable to answer the phone, but if you leave a message, I'll be sure and get back to you shortly. Thank...

Hello? Zoe.

You don't have to tiptoe(踮着脚走，蹑手蹑脚地走；回避).

I thought you fell asleep.

No. Just thinking about work.

I don't have anything for you yet. I will soon.

I know you will.

You can spend the night if you want.

Early meetings.

Wouldn't have time to get home and change.

You seem distracted(使分心，使转移注意力；<古>使困惑，使迷惑). 

I have a lot on my mind.

Like what?

Work, just like you. 

No Claire?

Or maybe she qualifies(有权去做；取得资格，达到标准；获得参赛资格；使合格，胜任；符合，可算作；具体说明，使语气缓和；修饰，限定) as work.

She didn't mention anything?

About...

I thought you didn't keep things from each other.

Look, just say what you want to say.

She came by here a few hours ago.

We had a nice little talk.

Don't let me keep you. You should go home, get some rest.

Tell Claire I said hi.

This is Claire. I'm unavailable to answer...

the lights in the Whartons' house will go on in a few moments.

They always get up precisely(精确的，准确的；恰好的) at quarter to 7:00, which is just the time that Claire would be going for her run, if she were here. Rebellion(叛乱，反抗) on all fronts. Claire, Zoe, Russo. I must not lose my resolve(<正式>决心，坚定的信念；<美>正式决定，决议；决定要做的事). I will march forward, even if I have to do so alone.

See? 

Good morning.

Hi, Frank.

How are you? 

I'm good.

Have you heard from Claire? 

Yeah, I got her message.

How's she feeling? 

A lot better.

Good. She said she'd be gone for the rest of the week.

Is it the flu or something? 

Something like that. I just came over to pick up a few things from her office.

I could've sent somebody over. 

Oh, no. It's no big deal. In fact, I also came here to ask you a favor.

You went to Stanford, correct?

Valedictorian(（毕业典礼上）致告别辞的最优秀毕业生)? Yeah.

Do you know the provost? 

Warren Tynsdale. He flies me out to do fundraising(募捐) events. Supposedly I'm the poster child for alumni(校友，毕业生). Making the world a better place.

Well, that is good, because this is important.

Linda Vasquez, the President's chief of staff. her son, Ruben, applied. I'd love for you to get on the phone with Tynsdale and tell him that they should accept him.

I don't know. I... I've never recommended anyone.

all the better. It'll carry more weight.

Can I meet Ruben first?

I would really prefer that Linda not know. In fact, it would be better if both she and Ruben believed he got in on merit(值得，应受；应受赏（或罚）) alone.

Will you please do this favor for Claire and me?  And for the President.

Thank you.

More contrast(差异，对比；对照物，明显不同的事物；（摄影或绘画中的）颜色反差，明暗对比).

We need to catch the edge of his face.

Let's re-crop it. Bring it in a quarter of an inch on the left.

Would you...

somebody named Claire?

Remy.

You hungry?
 
I don't eat pork.

When did that happen?

When we started lobbying for the meatpacking(肉类加工业) industry.

Freddy, half a rack for me, and some Collard Greens for my friend here.

I'm good. I already ate lunch.

Half a rack coming up.

I don't usually do business here. This is my little secret. I'd love it if we could keep it that way. I don't think you have to worry about me bringing clients by.

You seem tense(紧张的，焦虑的), Remy.

I assume(假定，假设，认为；装出，做出) you're upset about the watershed bill.

Not with you. You were just doing your job. But now I have to do mine. I'd like to propose(提议，建议；提出（理论或解释）；提名，推荐) a partnership.

I'm always open to partnerships, Frank.

If Peter Russo were a pro-natural gas candidate(候选人，申请者；有望体验（得到）……的人（物）), how valuable would that be to Sancorp?

The watershed bill was anti-drilling.

Peter's pro-employment, not anti-drilling. He just wants to bring employment to his people, and Sancorp is building refineries(精炼厂).

Mostly on site.

Do you think they would be open to considering Philadelphia?

I can talk with them, but I can't make any promises.

Oh, I don't want any promises. Just engage(雇用，聘请；参加，从事；吸引，引起) with Russo.

You know, give him a glimmer(微光；闪光；少许) of good fortune.

Frank, here you go.

Come on. Smell that. You sure you don't want to reconsider your stance(观点，态度，立场) on pork? Brain food, brother.

I love it. 850. You can afford that?

Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

First and last month are taken care of. So is the security deposit(支付（押金、订金或预缴费用）). That's to buy some furniture.

I'll pay you back. I promise.

It's not necessary. But I do need you to do one thing for me.

I come across as a hypocrite(伪君子，伪善者). 

You need jobs. Do you really care how you deliver them?

First, I advocate(拥护，提倡) for more regulation(规章制度，规则；（运用规则条例的）管理，控制) for the watershed, then I cozy(使感到舒适，使得意) up to the drilling interests?

Yeah, but natural gas is the future, Peter. This is an industry that could bring 100,000 jobs into your state over the next decade.

I agree with Peter. It seems like flip-flopping.(出尔反尔)

Sancorp's lobbying efforts is why we lost the watershed bill. But they can also be a very powerful ally(同盟国；盟友，支持者；辅助物，助手).

Our message is a "Fresh start." This makes you look like business as usual.

This is politics.

There are seized(抓住，捉住；（用武力）夺取) opportunities and missed opportunities. Seize this one, Peter.

Sancorp can commit to building new refineries in Philly?
 
Sancorp will commit to discussing it with you.

I need more than that. 

Look, you asked me to fix a problem. I've come to you in less than 24 hours with a solution. Can you meet me halfway(在中间，在中途；还可以，过得去)?

What would be the first step?

All right. You remember Remy Danton?

Oh, come on. He led the charge against the watershed bill.

I know. That's not the point. One of his other big clients is the McNeally cancer institute(研究所，学院，协会；（尤指与法律相关的）注释，论述). They're having a big gala tonight. a cocktail(鸡尾酒；混合物；杂锦冷盘) party. for their donors(捐赠者). Remy will be there.

We have events in Haverford and Gladwyne...

yeah, well, this is more important.

You also have a radio interview tomorrow morning with a local Pittsburgh station?

Yes. All right.

Meet with Remy tonight. And if it goes well and if you're comfortable, tomorrow morning on the radio, you support their drilling efforts.

And Remy has assured me if you do that, he can push Sancorp in the right direction.

Cancel the events tomorrow. Head back to Philly, do some damage control. I'll see you tomorrow afternoon. Peter... Please.

Okay. I'm gonna go make some calls.

Peter, have you mentioned anything to her about Kapeniak or...

No. I haven't mentioned it to anybody.

All right. Stamper will come by in the morning and brief you on the talking points.

When did you take this?

Oh, it was about 7:00 in the morning. The sun had just come up. You were asleep... right here. The light was perfect. I had no choice.

I always slept so well in this apartment.

How long are you in town for?

I don't know. I haven't decided.

You have no luggage(行李；精神负担).

It smells the same.

Feels the same.

I think Sancorp is missing out, not having a significant(显著的，相当数量的；重要的，意义重大的) presence(出席，存在；<正式>（某人的）所在地方) in Philadelphia. There are advantages to centralizing in a major urban(城市的，城镇的；黑人音乐的；住在都市的) center. But the disadvantages are commercial(商业的，商务的；商业化的) real estate(财产，遗产；大片私有土地，庄园) prices, city taxes, building a pipeline. It's all very costly. So they'd have to reduce costs elsewhere.

Significantly(显著地，相当数量地；值得注意的是). 

How can I help with that?

Statewide permitteduse(批准，许可；（使）成为可能；破例做，放纵) zoning. No more conditional(有条件的，有前提的；（从句）条件的) zoning. the municipalities(市民，自治市；市政公债) are slowing down development.

That's the state legislature.

You come out in support of permitted use, and you get elected Governor.

That'll put pressure on the legislature.
 
Sancorp is very interested in having a powerful friend in Harrisburg.

My opponent's pro-drilling. 

Your opponent isn't asking for refineries in Philadelphia.

We prefer friends we can count on.

Have your clients listen to WZPZ tomorrow at a quarter to 8:00.

It's a Pittsburgh station.

It's been a pleasure, Congressman.

I look forward to talking again soon.

You got a light(光，光线；光源（如电灯）；日光)?(打火机)

This is a cancer(癌症；痼疾) research event.

I know. I helped organize it.

You work for the institute(研究所，学院，协会)? No. The hotel.

And they let you smoke here?

No. The manager would kill me.

Well, at least it got you talking.

Are you having a good night? You look happy.

Uh, I am. I am. I'm having a great night.

Why? 

I just got some very good news.

We should celebrate. What are you drinking?

You know, I was just leaving, actually.

You haven't even asked my name yet.

I apologize, but I have to go. 

It's Rachel.

I'm not trying to be rude, but I got a big meeting tomorrow.

Then don't be rude. Just stay a few more minutes and keep me from having to mingle(（在聚会中）应酬，交际；（使）混合). My date(约会对象) ditched(挖沟，修渠；<非正式>摆脱) me. So if you abandon(抛弃，遗弃；（因危险）离开，舍弃) me now, that would be very rude. These heels(脚后跟；鞋后跟；高跟鞋) are killing me. Feel that. Feel that blister(因烧伤或摩擦引起的）水疱；（物体表面的）气泡).

Hey, I...I have a girlfriend.

I'd be surprised if you didn't.

Why'd your date ditch you?

Mmm. Very scandalous(令人愤慨的，可耻的；丑闻的).

What happened?

Clink(发叮当声) glasses with me.(跟我碰个杯)

I'm petite(（女子）娇小的；（妇女服装）小号的), but I can hold my liquor(烈性酒；酒精类饮料；（某种加工过程中所产生或使用的）液，汁).

Obviously(（用于强调）显然，显而易见；明显地).

When I do get drunk, though...

I get undressed.

What about you?

What are you like when you get drunk?(喝醉)

It's not pretty. 

Pretty's overrated(高估，对……评价过高). I like it when things get a little bit ugly. When I work late nights, they let me stay at the hotel, so I don't have to drive home. This one is yours. Room 1121.

Sir?

In here.

You wanted to see me?

I need you to locate somebody.

Who?

My wife.

Do you have a way of doing that?

I do, sir.

I know a guy in missing persons...

she's not missing, I just don't know where she is at the moment.

I trust him. We can do this off the books.(我们可以私下办)

Good.

I'll get on it right away.

Come on. Give us another one.

No. I'll tell you why. Because my mother always used to tell me to smile more. Always drove me crazy. She'd say, "Claire", "Why have you that scowl(怒容) all the time? You look so much more beautiful when you smile." It was never a real conversation. There was never, "Oh, what do you feel?" Or "What are you thinking?" Just so long as I looked beautiful and happy. That's all she cared about.

So you want me to ask you what you're thinking and feeling?

All the time.

I actually do wanna know what you're thinking and feeling. How sad am I? 

Yes, so tell me first.

What? 

Tell me first.

I think I'd better get dressed. 

What? Why?

Uh, because I've got friends coming over, and as a host, I should probably wear clothes.

Really? 

Yeah.

Why do you do that? 

Well, you know.

It's proper(真正的，像样的；实际上的)? 

Kind of.

Oh, fuck.

Thought you might have bailed(保释；（往外）舀水；从……中摆脱出来；离开).

Sit down.

Vodka or whiskey?

Uh, you go ahead.

Come on. You can be a good boy downstairs, not up here.

Seriously, I'm good.

Whiskey, I think.

So what's your good news?

I wanna know what we're celebrating.

Why did your, uh... why did your date ditch you?

I asked you first. I did, downstairs.

He works on the Hill. Some staffer or something. I don't know. I think he's a glorified(赞美；美化；崇拜（神）；使更壮丽) gofer(皱纹；兼勤杂工作的办事员). A friend set me up with him. So I said he should come tonight, keep me company.(keep company 陪伴（某人）) But all he wanted to do was schmooze(闲谈，聊天；亲密交谈). So I brought him into the women's bathroom, told him he was being an asshole(愚蠢的；窝囊的；可恶的). He told me I was being childish. So I slapped(（用手掌）打，拍；拍打，拍击) him.

You slapped him?

Yeah. Big red hand mark right across his face.

I think he was embarrassed to be seen by the Schmoozerati.

So he left.

And that is the last timemI go on a date with a guy who wears a flag pin(国旗胸针) to work.

I'm one of those guys who wears a flag pin to work.

This isn't really a date, is it?

I really shouldn't be here.

That's what makes it fun.

Tell me your good news. I wanna know what we're toasting to.

Let's toast(为……举杯敬酒，为……干杯；烤，烘) to you.

I'm your good news? Okay, I'll toast to that.

What are you...

I didn't wanna wait at the Herald. I was gonna call you, but...

Can I stay at your place tonight?

Uh, stay with me?

Well, just on your couch(长沙发，长榻；诊察台) for a night or two.

Uh, why?

I can't be in my apartment.

Did something happen? 

No. I... I'm sorry.

Zoe. Come on.

What time is the interview?

Quarter to 8:00. I'll be with him.

And where's Peter now?

Are you sure you want the details?

Just tell me, is it going well?

Hasn't been any updates. But if it does go well, you'll be ready?

I'm ready. I've been ready. I'm ready.

Anything else? We never played chess(国际象棋，西洋棋) before, have we?

I don't know how.

You want me to teach you?

I should really get some rest.

Be fresh for the morning.

Yeah, another time.

1160, WZPZ, 7:45. Good night.

I hate being kept in the dark. Waiting. Speculating(猜测，推测；投机). Useless(无用的，无价值的；差劲的，无能的).

Oh, come on! Let's dance.

It's not a big deal.

Come on, let's do it. No.

No, please, I can't. Not now.

Come on.

This is really nice.

Do you want anything? Water? Juice?

No, thanks. I'm good.

Uh, you can have the bed. I'll sleep on the couch.

No. No.
 
It's fine.

Please, Lucas, let me sleep on the couch. I'll feel bad.

All right.

Can I help? I got it.

So, you know, we don't have to talk if you don't want to.

But I haven't seen you in, like, six months. Except for when I drunkenly(醉醺醺地；东倒西歪的) stalked(偷偷接近，潜近；跟踪，盯梢；怒冲冲地走) you at your...

Right. That was kind of adorable(可爱的，讨人喜欢的；<罕>值得崇拜的).

It was either psychotic(精神病的) or sad.  Not adorable.

Yes, it was.

Can you hand me that pillow(枕头；蕾丝枕头)?

So, why do you need to get out of your apartment?
 
It just felt small.

Well, it can't be smaller than my place.

No. I don't mean size. I mean...I felt trapped(设陷阱（或夹子、捕捉器）捕捉；使陷入圈套). Like I was in a place that I didn't actually live.

Does that make any sense?

I guess.

Okay. There you go.

Um, anytime you need to get up?
  
Um, I'll just set an alarm on my phone.

All right. Well, feel free to watch TV.

I can sleep through anything.

Hey, thank you, Lucas.

Hey, that's the last of it.

Better make it count, then.

Drink up.

Do I look familiar to you?

Familiar? No.

My face? My body? 

No.

How about my voice?

Have we...

No. I was just wondering if you had a thing for brunettes(n. 浅黑肤色的女人 | adj. 深色的) with blue eyes.

Hey, where you going? Come back here.

I wanna see you better.

Shit. The sun's up?

Has been for a while.

Oh, fuck. What time is it? 7:15.

Fuck. I have an interview in half an hour.

Skip it. 

I can't. I gotta do it.

You can keep the room till noon.

Hello? 

I'm at your building.

The front desk keeps calling up, but there's no answer.(前台一直打电话，但是没人接)

I'm not there. Then I'll come to you. Where are you?

I'm... I'm at the Park Highmore hotel.

Are you okay? You sound drunk.

It was, uh... yeah. Yeah. I'm... I'm all right.

You have the interview. 

I know!

Have you been drinking, Peter?
 
Uh, what? No. Um, I just decided to spend the night here.

What room are you in?

11, uh... 1121.

Stay there. I'm coming right now.

Jesus, Peter. What happened? You're drunk.

I'm fine. I can smell it on you.

Okay, I had a drink or two.

It was nothing crazy.

We can't do this interview.

I'm sober(未喝醉的，清醒的；严肃的). I can handle it.

You're slurring(发音含糊的) your words.

I'm good.

I think we should cancel.

I'm gonna do the interview.

Just give me the talking points.

Sorry. Sorry. I...

It's all right.

The couch had a spring in it or something, and my back...

No. It's all right.I don't mind.

Sir, I heard from my friend. Missing persons.(失踪人口)

And?

She's in New York. 

What hotel?

Not a hotel, sir.

So she's not alone.

No, sir.

Adam Galloway?

Yes, sir.

I have more information.

I don't need to know.

Turn on 1160 A.M.

He's running to fill Jim Matthews' old post as Governor of Pennsylvania.

Glad to have you with us, sir.

It's good to be here, Jim.

It's mark. 

Sorry. Right. Mark.

That's okay, Congressman.

It happens all the time this early in the morning. So, Congressman, the watershed act. Yes. Uh, I'm ashamed(惭愧的，感到难为情的；耻于……的) of the...well, I'm not ashamed. That's not the right, um...I'm disappointed, um, because, you know, the water... um... it's... actually, what I'd like to discuss is...we all know that natural gas... that it's... it's growing... uh, in our state... it's a big part of, um... economically(经济地；在经济上；节俭地), the way things are going. and I'd like to say... to announce... in terms of, um... Are you familiar with drilling regulations...permitted(批准，许可；（使）成为可能) use versus(（比赛或诉讼中）以……为对手，与……竞争；与……相对，与……相比) conditional use?

Are we still talking about the watershed?

No. Drilling. Natural gas.

Sir, you supported increased regulation.

Well, no. I... I...it may have looked that way, but, uh, in fact, to be clear, I'm for less...regulation.

Yes, sir.

In the watershed bill, the language clearly stated...

it didn't pass.

Well, right. That's what I'm asking about.

What about it? Why it didn't pass?

I just said.

No, sir. I don't think you did.

It just didn't.

Sir, three days ago, you predicted(预测，预言，预报)...

I'm talking about fucking natural gas. I'm sorry.

Congressman, I have to ask you a question, and it may come across as indelicate(无教养的；不文雅的；下流的，粗俗的), but are you drunk right now?

What? No. No. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just... I'm really tired, you know. I've been on the campaign trail(拖，拉；没精打采地走，拖沓地走) for a few weeks now,

Congressman?  Congressman? Congressman?

It's my fault.

I shouldn't have let you.

I'm fucked.

Okay. Listen. We sober(（使）变得持重，变得冷静；（使）醒酒，（使）清醒) you up.

We'll make some kind of announcement as soon as possible.

There's nothing I can say.

We'll figure(（以重要地位）出现；<美，非正式>认为，估计；理解，弄懂；计算；用图画（或图形等）描绘，想象) this out.(figure out 计算出,想出,理解,解决） Come on. You're gonna take a shower. Come on. There you go. Come on.

How bad is it?

It all depends on whether it gets picked up by the mainstream(主流的) press.

Well, shall I fill in the president? 

No. Hold off on that. I need to speak to Peter, coordinate(协调，配合；使身体协调 ) with his campaign.

You'll be the first call I make.

Frank, before you go, I got an email this morning. Stanford reversed their decision.

That's wonderful.

The Provo said Gillian Cole reached out to him. I googled her. She works for Claire. Thank you. 

No reason to thank me.

Ruben was just ecstatic(狂喜的；出神的，入迷的). I don't know how I'm gonna repay you.

The fact that your son is happy is more than enough.

You'll keep me posted on Peter? 

You bet.(当然)

Okay.

Hey, boss.

Are you still with him? Yeah. He's taking a shower. 

How're we looking?

Zoe Barnes posted ten minutes ago. It's already on the New York times web site. The kid is done.

Have Nancy set up a meeting with the Vice President. Today if possible. 

Will do.

And keep an eye on Peter. He's done his duty. Let's get him back on his feet.(让他重新振作起来) 

You got it.

And now Jim Matthews comes to the fore, though he doesn't know it yet. He will find solace(安慰；慰藉；安慰之物) in his beloved(心爱的；挚爱的 | n. 心爱的人；亲) Pennsylvania, though Peter Russo will find solace(安慰；慰藉；安慰之物) nowhere. It only takes ten seconds to crush(压坏，挤压变形；捣碎) a man's ambitions(追求的目标，抱负；雄心，野心；干劲). I need to take care that I protect mine.

Peter. Peter, Peter?

### Chapter 11

This is Russo. Please leave a message.

He's not answering my calls. It's over, and he must know it. 

You don't think there's any way he can recover?

The Republicans will play that interview on every radio and television station from now until November 5th.

I sympathize with the kid, but this was my concern(担心，忧虑；使人担忧的事物；关心) from the beginning.

And I should've listened to you, sir. I thought he could handle the pressure.

Okay. So he withdraws(（军队）撤离； 脱离（社会），不与人交往；离开).

We need to replace him.

You have any ideas?

With less than two months to go?

If the President hadn't shut me out of the early discussions, I could've come up with some good options, but I don't know anyone
who's got the name recognition(承认，接受；表彰，赞誉；认出，识别；（政府对他国的）外交认可) and donor base to start a campaign from scratch just seven weeks out. Let me think.

Everything hinges(给（某物）装铰链) on the next few minutes... all my months of planning, every move I've made.  There is one person. 

Who?

You, Mr. Vice President.

If you ran to reclaim(要求归还；利用，改造（荒地）；回收) your seat, I think you'd win by a landslide(山崩；大胜利).

Resign the vice presidency.

Only if you win.

Walker needs me for 2016.

Are you entirely certain he's gonna keep you on the ticket? I mean, it's no secret the two of you don't exactly get along.(get along 进展, 相处, 过活)

What has he said?

Oh, you're putting me in a very awkward(令人尴尬的，使人难堪的；难对付的) position, Mr. Vice President.

Has he been bad-mouthing me?

Well, the exact phrase he used was "Pain in the ass."(讨厌鬼)

That fucker.(那个混蛋)

He's got no idea how to lead, no sense of respect.

Oh, is this his idea? 

No.

His way of getting rid(使……去掉，使……去除；摆脱，消除) of me? 

No. It struck(打，撞；（用手或武器等）打；（使）碰撞) me yesterday, and I just thought it was worth suggesting. But, no, I haven't discussed this with anyone.

And you shouldn't. People don't leave the White House to become a governor.

May I ask you a personal question, sir?  Do you want to be the Vice President?

Peter said that when you were out on that campaign trail(（特定）路线，路径；一系列（坏事或有害事件）), you had so much enthusiasm(热情，热忱；热衷的活动，热爱的事物) and energy that he thought you maybe missed being the Governor.

I do miss it.

Then why not go back?

You could be the hero of this election and secure(获得，得到；使安全，保护) Pennsylvania for the Democrats in 2016.

Garrett would never go along with something like this, even if he hates my guts(肠，肠道；内脏).

It would make him look weak, like he's lost control of the administration.

Not if it was a mutual(相互的，彼此的；共同的) decision. Look, let me talk to Garrett. I won't mention that we've spoken.

I suppose there's no harm in finding out what he thinks.

Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

Slogans for 400. "1976. He's making us proud again."

D.J. Who is Carter. D.J.

No. John. Who is Ford.

Peter?

Slogans for 600.

Peter, are you here?

"1888. Grandfather's hat fits Ben."

Claudia. Who is Benjamin Harrison.

Yes. Presidential slogans for 800.

"1900. The full dinner pail(桶，提桶；一桶的量)"

On the train ride down, I almost called the police to have them break in and make sure you hadn't hurt yourself. I'm not gonna even ask you what happened. It doesn't matter right now. What matters right now...

Who is Goldwater.

who is Goldwater.

Barry Goldwater. Yes.

Oh, come on. Hey, I'm watching that.

What matters is the 50 reporters in front of your building and the 150 campaign staffers who don't know if they still have a job.

It's over.

I know.

So, tell them to go away.

What, are you just gonna hole yourself up in here and hope it all goes away?

Yeah, that's pretty much the plan.

Well, I won't let you.

Hey, put that down. Hey.

Hey, put that down! 

Peter...We need to put out a statement. Call me when you're prepared to do that. I'll be at the headquarters(将（组织的）总部设在某地；设立总部) in Philly.

I was scared(使惊恐，吓唬；害怕，恐惧) that I was starting to feel too much for you. I think that's why I ended it.

And you have no room for fear?

No. Being afraid doesn't accomplish(完成，实现) anything.

That's not true. When I'm overseas, rational(合理的，基于理性的) fear... disease or violence(暴力，暴行；（言行的）狂暴)...that sort of fear keeps you alive. Back here, God, I find myself afraid of things that I can't name or point to. It's like, uh, how little am I seeing? Or have I wasted this day or this moment?

Yeah, I think that sometimes...whether my life will add up. Francis would roll his eyes if he heard me talking like this.

Does he know where you are?

No, he doesn't.

If he's looking for you, that's where you are. Over there. Before you met Frank.

Alone. Curious(好奇的，求知欲强的；稀奇的，不寻常的；爱挑剔的). Absorbing(吸收；使并入，纳入；同化，汲取；消减) everything.

You have no idea what I was like when I was a girl.

Did he ever know that side of you?

He wasn't interested in that girl. And neither was I.

What were you interested in?

Being more than an observer.

You wanted to be seen.

Not just seen.

I wanted to be significant(显著的，相当数量的；重要的，意义重大的).

There's no historical precedent(先例，前例；判例，实例；常规，惯例).

Aaron Burr ran for Governor, Calhoun for the Senate.

200 years ago.

One shot a man in a duel(决斗；斗争，抗争), the other believed in slavery(奴隶制，蓄奴；奴隶身份，奴役；过分依赖，过分投入). Is that really the sort of company(公司；陪伴，同伴；宾客，来宾；在一起的一群人) we wanna share, Frank?

Mr. President, we stand losing control of an important swing(摇摆，摆动) state, our majority in the house, and quite possibly your second term in office. Preventing(阻止，阻碍；防止，预防；设置障碍) all of that may require unconventional(非常规的，不依惯例的) measures(措施；层组).

It would look like I'm pushing him out. Or worse... that he's abandoning(抛弃，遗弃；（因危险）离开，舍弃) the administration.

You make a joint statement. You say he won't resign unless he wins. If he loses, he stays on as Vice President. No one could accuse(控告，指控；指责，谴责，归咎于) either of you of disloyalty(不忠实；不义，不贞；背信弃义) to the other.

Did Jim come to you with this?

No. It's entirely my idea. I wouldn't dream of speaking to the Vice President without passing it by you first.

I think he'd take it as an affront(（当众）侮辱，（故意）冒犯), like I'm trying to get rid of him.

Honestly, sir, I think he might be more interested than you imagine.

Why is that? 

Well, I hesitate(犹豫，不愿意) to bring this up, but when he was campaigning for Russo, he spoke quite freely(自由地；免费地；大量地；慷慨地；直率地) about you, sir.

Tell me.

Of course, I'm getting this secondhand from Peter, but the gist(要点，主旨，大意；<法律>诉讼要点) of it is that... that you lack entirely in leadership, and that you have no sense of respect. 

And he wants more responsibility. And how do I give him that when he shows absolutely no discretion(自行决定权，判断力；谨慎，慎重), no discipline(纪律，风纪；惩罚，处分)?

Well, that is entirely my point. Now, look, I take full responsibility for backing Russo, but there could be a silver(银；银器（尤指餐具）；银币；银（白）色) lining in all this. You could accomplish two goals: Secure Pennsylvania for the Democrats and find an honorable(光荣的；可敬的；高贵的) way to replace Matthews.

What do you think?

I think it is a very big decision, and we do not want to make it impulsively(有推动力地).

I agree. I'd like to put some more thought into it.

Well, that is very prudent(谨慎的，慎重的；节俭的), sir. Just bear(手持，携带；（车，船）运输，运送；写有，刻有) in mind, seven weeks out, that every day counts.

Hi, sir. 

How much is it?

Oh, I got your receipt(发票，收据；<正式>收到) right here.

No, no, no. It was... it was just $40.

Yeah. Don't tell anyone, all right?

No. I... I never say anything about our tenants(房客；居住者).

The press still outside? 

Yeah. I told them you weren't here, like you said.

Most of them left. There's still, you know, a few, though.

If I wanted to leave, is there a place I could do it without being seen?

Yeah. The freight(货物；货运) elevator down to the garage.

I could call you a cab or...

All right. Thanks. I'll let you know.

Mr. Russo, uh... sir, it's none of my business, but, uh, my uncle... he fell off the wagon(四轮运货车；<英>（无顶的）铁路货车车厢) a few times. When he did, the best thing for him was just not to be alone.

I'll give you this money back, I'll take that bag off your hands, come in here, keep you company(陪伴，同伴)...

I appreciate it. I'll let you know if I change my mind.

would you come over? we need to talk.

Sit down.

Where's Claire?

Not here.

So what is this, tying up loose ends?

I wouldn't presume(料想，（不肯定地）认为；假设，设想). People like you can't be neatly tied up.(被占用的（东西等）；脱不了身的；忙得不可开交的（人）；绑扎了的；有关系的)

But I thought perhaps we could start...

This is the dress she wore to the gala. I believe so. It is. I recognize it.

Go back into the bedroom.

I'm amazed(使惊奇，使惊愕) how well you got her in focus.

What should we call her?

Why does she need a name?

I never photograph anyone without knowing their name.

You didn't take the photograph. I did.

I think we should call her Claire.

She doesn't even look like me. Not even a younger version. Why do you keep saying that?

Not her features, her expression(表达，表示；表情，神情). Hey, we should mount(组织，开展；爬上，登上；骑上；镶嵌，裱贴，安置；上演，展出；) it. You can hang her in your house.

Would Francis object(反对；反对说，反对的理由是)?

Can we please not discuss Francis?

You brought him up in the park.

I know I did, and I shouldn't have.

So we have to pretend(伪装，假装) he doesn't exist?

I thought we could talk about anything.

He is a presence(出席，存在；<正式>（某人的）所在地方) here. You must admit that.

When you walked through the door yesterday, he walked right in with you.

It's just me, nobody else.

You keep telling yourself that, it might come true.

How do you think she'd feel if she knew I was wearing this?

I don't know.

You don't think she'd be upset?

She'd probably say you look very beautiful in it.

It's like steel(钢，钢铁；钢铁工业).

You should put it back.

I think I'll keep it.

I'll buy you one of your own, if you'd like.

No. I want this one.

She came into my bedroom. She should know I came into hers. Is your bed always so perfectly made?

It's a habit I formed(（使）出现；（使）（关系、习惯或想法）形成；构成，是……的组成部分) at military school.

What side of the bed does she sleep on?

That side.

She can keep it. Fits her better anyway.

Listen, Zoe...

Whatever just happened upstairs, whatever these past six months have been, can we agree that it is time to simplify(使简易，简化)?

What does simple l ok like?

We maintain our professional arrangement, as you suggested, which I will honor.

You still trust me?

What choice do I have?

You didn't hurt me or discard me like you said you would.

I'm glad(高兴的；感激的；乐意的) I didn't have to.

Yes, we'll agree to simplify.

Good.

Sorry I'm a few minutes late, Frank. Please, have a seat.

I have a pretty good idea why you asked for this meeting.

Have you and the President had a chance to speak? 

We have.

Is he leaning one way or another? 

He's torn(犹豫的).

And what about you? 

I'm a little less torn. My instincts(本能，天性；直觉；天分，天赋) tell me it's a mistake.

You wanna convince(使确信，使信服；说服，劝服) me otherwise(否则，不然；除此以外，在其他方面；不同地，另外地)?

Well, look, if your instincts tell you this is not the way to go, I'm not about to...

Frank, I'm gonna ask you  two very direct questions, and I would appreciate direct answers. When you got my son into college, were you anticipating(预期，预料；预见) a moment like this?

I don't follow.(我不明白你的意思)

Honestly, Frank?

Was I antici...

I would be happy to answer you directly if I knew what you were asking.

All right. I will ask you my second question. Do you want the Vice Presidency for yourself?

I would serve at the pleasure of the President. That was his...

you proposed(提议，建议；提出) this idea so that you can take Matthews' place.

I did not say that. 

But it is what you want.

What I want is in the... 

The President makes you V.P., you on the ticket in 2016, and you use that as a springboard to run in 2020. Tell me that trajectory(（物体射向或抛向空中形成的）轨道，轨迹；（事业等的）发展轨迹，起落；（几何）常角轨道，轨线) has never entered your mind.


Well, Linda, I make a habit of considering all trajectories in any given situation. But that's a practical(真实的，实际的) exercise(运动，锻炼；（一套）动作，体操；练习，演练；运用；活动，任务；典礼；宗教仪式，礼拜), not a personal one.

So you refuse to admit it.

Admit it's what I want? That's irrelevant(不相关的，不相干的).

You're the one who asked for this meeting, not me.

This meeting's about trying to solve a problem,vnot fulfill some personal ambition.

But if both could be achieved, you wouldn't object.

I think this is a sound course of action regardless of who the President taps to replace Matthews.

I must gamble(冒险假设；赌博；冒险，投机) everything I have right now. If I'm honest, she may use it against me. If I'm not, she won't lift a finger. I've used the same tactic(策略，手法；战术，兵法) myself. Once someone is exposed, they're at your mercy(仁慈，宽恕；<非正式>幸运，恩惠；慈善，怜悯). She wants to hear me say the words.

Yes. I want to be the Vice President. And, yes, I helped your son get into college in the hopes that you would return the favor. But I can't force you to do so, Linda. But I also think that we would make a formidable(可怕的，令人敬畏的；（形状、数量）巨大的；难对付的) team.Look what we've been able to accomplish even when we've been at odds with each other. Now put your mind to what we could accomplish if we weren't. Thank you for taking the time, Linda.

I'll call you back. How'd it go?

She's holding her cards very close to the chest(胸部，胸膛；箱子，盒子，柜子；<英>金库，钱库).

Any word from Peter? 

Nothing.

Christina said he wouldn't leave the apartment. But I called the doorman, and he said that Peter was gone.

Where? 

He doesn't know.

He needs to officially withdraw to put pressure on Walker.

I'm trying to track him down.

Why'd you let him out of your sight in the first place?

I thought he was showering. He disappeared when I was on the phone with you.

There was a plan here, Doug.

He explodes(（使）爆炸，（使）爆破；急剧扩大，激增；（情感）迸发，爆发；推翻，破除；爆响，发出巨响；迅速移动), he withdraws, we put him back together, and he quietly goes away.

Russo has made no public appearances since allegations(（无证据的）说法，指控) that he was inebriated(酒醉的) during a radio interview on WZPZ Pittsburgh yesterday morning. Sources among the Democratic leadership have suggested that the party is currently considering options to replace Russo. Meanwhile, Republican candidate Jack Swofford's lead has jumped to a 24 point margin, according to an overnight CNN poll of registered voters. The Swofford campaign is also reporting a sharp spike(猛增，急升) in contributions...nearly half a million dollars in the last 20...

I saw that this morning.

Francis got Peter to run.

Do you know him well?

We weren't close.

Do you need to make calls? Cause I can head into the other room. 

I don't think so. Thanks.

Where are you going?

To the lab. I should've gone in today.

Adam. Adam... 

Just go. Go. Leave.

How long do you think this can possibly go on for? we have never spent more than 48 hours together. Maybe there's a reason for that.

A part of me still loves you.

Which part? I can't be just a pit stop, Claire, or some sort of escape... 

Oh, come on. You're more than that. 

or a top-up on whatever Francis can't provide. 

Oh, fuck off! He's my husband, Adam.

We've gone through more than you could ever imagine.

I envy(羡慕，忌妒；向往，渴望) your free spirit(精神，心灵；情绪，心境), and I'm attracted(吸引；（物体间）产生引力；引起；有吸引力) to it, but not all of us have that luxury(奢华，华贵；奢侈品；不常有的乐趣，难得的享受).

Which is what I find so frustrating(使懊恼，使沮丧；挫败，阻挠；受挫) about you, Claire.

You... you had a choice. You chose not to be free.

No. What I chose was a man I could love for more than a week.

I shouldn't have said that. I...

At least you're being honest.

I can't live moment to moment like you, Adam.

I have a history with Francis, I have a future with him, and it's bigger than a moment.

Then you should kill it...whatever part of you still loves me.

If you can't,

I will.

Adam... 

No.

Hello? Hey. Hey, sweetie.

How's it going? I'm... are you with your mom?

She's downstairs. You want me to go get her?

No. No. I just wanted to call and say, you know, hey to your... uh, your brother and you. Is he... is he there?

He's in his room, I think.

Okay. You wanna go get him?

Hold on.

He says he doesn't want to talk to you.

What? Why not?

We've seen the news, dad. There were all sorts of TV cameras at our school yesterday. Mom's making us stay home this week.

I want you to do something. I want you to go to, uh, your bedroom window and look out. You see that black car? 

Yeah. 

That's me.

You shouldn't be here, dad. Mom would be really angry.

Well, we don't need to tell her. Right? It'll just be... it'll just be, uh... it'll just be our little secret.

Your voice sounds weird(奇怪的，不寻常的；怪异的，超自然的), like it did on the radio.

You... you heard that?

I have a computer.

I'm sorry. I...sometimes your dad makes mistakes.

ter go. No.

I don't like to hear your voice when it's like this. It makes me sad. Bye, dad.

Sarah, please...

Peter?

Christina.

Where are you?

I'm, uh... I'm not... I'm not... I'm not doing so well.

where're you, Peter?

I'm in my car. Are you driving?

No.

Tell me where you are.

I'm outside my kids' house.

You mean Madeleine's? 

Yeah.

I need you to stay right there. Okay, Peter? You'll stay there?

Peter. Peter, are you still there?

Hello? Hello?

I'd like to turn myself in.(我想要自首)

For what?

A few months ago, I was pulled over for drunk driving. They let me go. I should've been convicted(定罪，宣判……有罪).

Well, if you were let go, sir, we can't arrest you for it now.

Well, I drunk drove here. Arrest me for that.

We can put you in a detox(排毒；（对吸毒者或酗酒者的）脱瘾治疗) tank(<英，非正式> 喝醉)...

I wanna be formally arrested. My name is Congressman Peter Russo. I was arrested in January on Michigan Avenue.

Please have a seat, Congressman.

I gotta make a few phone calls.

Have you found him?

I'm in front of his exwife's house. Christina said he called from there.

He's not there? 

No. But his phone is. I found it by the curb(<美>路缘，马路牙子).

So we have no way to contact him?

Not unless he reaches out to us.

This isn't good.

Want me to alert the authorities?

Let's give him a little longer.

How long did it last? 

About six months.

He was older. A lot?

Yeah.

Was he a journalist, or did he work on The Hill?

I'd rather not say.

All right.

He was someone I looked up to... for a while.

Why did it end?

He has a wife. We both knew it was gonna end eventually(最终，结果). I mean, it was really... it was fucked up. The first night we spent together, he told me he was gonna hurt me and then discard me. And when it ended, I told him that he'd done neither. But...it does hurt.

I won't hurt you.

Yeah, you can't promise me that.

Yes, I can.

Has anyone else seen him? 

No.

He's in an interrogation(审问，盘问；查询；疑问句) room by himself.  I never should've got mixed up with this fucking mess.

We're way behind regret(懊悔，惋惜) time, Barney. Just have your guys keep him out of sight. I'll need a back exit.

I got him. 

Thanks. 

Yeah. Come on.

Hey, Peter. Where's your car?

It's down the street.

I'll drive you home. You go back to mine, have Meechum let you in.

This way? 

Yeah.

What were you thinking, Peter?

I need to take responsibility for my actions.

By getting yourself thrown in jail?

Real responsibility.

Like... like they talk about in the meetings, not the lies we told for the campaign.

What you just did was extremely(极度，非常) reckless(鲁莽的，不计后果的；粗心大意的).

I don't care.

I'm making a statement tomorrow, Frank.

About pulling out of the race?

That's not enough. I...

I need to stop hiding.

Well, let's work together on the language.

I have to do it on my own. It's gotta be my own words.

Look, Peter, this isn't just about you anymore, all right?

Let me help you. 

I don't want your help.

I didn't never ask your help when you... I got arrested. When did your help ever help me? You can live your life the way you want to. I'm done being told how to live mine.

Well, there has to be a way to take responsibility without shattering(破碎，碎裂；破坏，摧毁) everything.

Are you at least willing to have that discussion?

Do you want me to come upstairs? 

No.

I know you're in a lot of pain, Peter. But I don't want you to feel any pain tonight. Here. You can start fresh tomorrow. Go ahead. I won't judge you. Hell, I'll even join you. Just relax. You're home now. Whatever it is you have to face tomorrow, you don't have to face it now. Right now it's just you and me. The rest of the world doesn't matter. Your children, Christina...they will forgive you, because you're loved, Peter.

Failed. I failed myself. I failed my family. I failed the campaign.

No, you haven't, Peter.

May I?

You know, when Claire and I were first married, we talked about having children. I told her flat out I didn't want any.(flat-out 直率的开足马力) It was selfish(自私的，利己的) but honest. I didn't have a particularly happy childhood. I suspect you didn't either.

No.

You see, no person avoids pain. And I just didn't think it was right to bring a child in knowing that. But now when I think back, I...I realize that was cowardly(怯懦的，胆小的；恃强凌弱的). 

I see you, and I think, well, there's a brave man, far braver than me. I'm so tired. When I... when I think about... when I...I'm so tired.

You should close your eyes. Let it all go. We have all the time in the world. Peter? Peter.

I walked back. Whatever happens in the next few hours, whatever you hear, we will never speak of it.

Sir...I heard from Linda about a half an hour ago. The President wants to meet with you.

8:30.

About what?

I don't know.

Frank.

Now, when you brought up this idea, I wasn't sold(卖，销售). It struck me as both desperate(不顾一切的，拼命的；极需要的，渴望的) and careless. But then Linda laid(放；铺设；安排) out all the pros(赞成者；赞成的意见), and they clearly outweigh(超过) the cons(反对者). I explained our reasoning to Jim and hoped he wouldn't think I was off my rocker.

I did at first, but the President made some very good arguments(争论，争吵；论据，理由；辩论). It's a bold(大胆自信的，敢于冒险的；冒失的) move, Frank. I'm very impressed(钦佩的，印象深刻的).

Well, thank you, sir, for being open to the idea. And thank you, Mr. President, for taking the risk.

We'll need to work this out step by step. The execution has to be perfect.

Where are things with Russo? Any word from him yet?

We're still trying to locate him.

Well, is there any cause for worry? It's been two days.

I am a bit worried, I have to admit. I mean, this must be an extremely difficult moment for him. We're hoping he'll reach out shortly.

Let's get our people on it. I wanna know where he is. Now, once he withdraws, we have to move quickly. We'll make a joint statement, as you proposed(提议；计划).

It's a clear message, I think. Pennsylvanians matter to us, and we're not gonna let them down.

That's right. I'll say that Jim's an invaluable asset to the White House, but that I have great admiration(钦佩，赞美，欣赏；赞美对象) for the sacrifice(牺牲，献出；献祭，供奉) he's willing to make for the people of his home state.

And you should not accept his resignation until he's elected. That will show your continuing commitment(忠诚，献身；承诺，保证；奉献) to him.

I think that's a good idea. 

As long as I can devote(献身，致力；用于) myself wholly to the campaign, I agree.

Now, should Jim win, we'll need to nominate(提名，推荐；任命，指派；挑选) a Vice President immediately.

Linda, you're putting together a list of names?

Yes. And you can begin the vetting(仔细检查；彻底审查) process as soon as you narrow(眯起来；使缩小，压缩；使变窄，变窄) down the choices.

I already have a short list of top contenders(竞争者；争夺者).

I want your input on that, Jim.

More than happy.

Congressman? Congressman?

We can use the existing infrastructure(下面结构；永久性军事设施；基础设施，基础建设). Are you okay with Nash Aarons?

I like Nash, but I'll want to bring in some of my own people.

Well, that won't be a problem. Nash is a team player.

And we can reallocate(重新分配；再指派) some of your existing 2016 reelection funds... 

Excuse me. Linda.

Peter Russo is dead. Suicide(自杀；自杀者；自杀性的行为). He was found in his garage with the car still running. I'm so sorry, Frank.

May I have a moment, sir? 

Of course.

I will get more information and start drafting a statement.

Let's reschedule. Whenever is best for Frank.

Congressman Peter Russo was found dead early this morning in the parking garage of his apartment building in Washington D.C.

why didn't we break this?

U.S. Secret Service Agents discovered his body after reports that Russo had been missing since Saturday.

Fuck!

His body was transferred to the D.C. Coroner's office where an autopsy(验尸，尸体剖检) is expected to confirm his death as a suicide. A junior(年龄较小的；地位（或级别）低的) congressman from Philadelphia. Russo was 36 years old

Zoe. Look at this. And is survived(活下来，幸存；比……活得久) by two children.

I gotta get to the office.

Russo was in the midst(中部，中间) of a heated(>激起，使激动；加热，使变暖) battle for the governorship of Pennsylvania.

He was last heard publicly during a morning political radio show on Pittsburgh station WZPZ. Now, during the interview, he slurred(含混不清地说话) his words, he sounded disoriented(分不清方向或目标的；无判断力的) leading many to believe that he had relapsed(故态复萌). Right here on this TV station for all the late-breaking details about this major news story: the suicide of congressman Peter Russo.

Christina.

Can you get me a train back to D.C.?

I find it very difficult to express everything that I'm feeling right now, and I know Claire feels exactly the same. 

Peter was very special to us. A sort of magnetic(磁的，磁性的) presence(出席，存在) that electrified(使电气化；使充电；使触电；使激动) everyone he touched. my husband and I became very close to him in the past serval month.

peter was more than a college, more than a friend. he was family. our heart go out to his children and his mother. to all of those who knew him, and worked with him and loved him. we would ask that all of you respect their privacy and honor their lost. today is indeed a sad day for the United States' congress, for the state of Pennsylvania, and for all of us. thank you very much.

### Chapter 12

Hey. Excuse me.

I'm Paul Capra. I'm here to see Christina.

Oh, right this way, Mr. Capra. She's expecting you.

Paul. Hi. 

Hey, Christina.

It's good to see you. 

Yeah, you too.

Can I get you anything?

Nah. I grabbed some breakfast on the way down.

Okay. Have a seat. 

All right. Thank you.

I asked you down here because I spoke to D triple(三倍的，三重的；三部分的，三人的) C and the D.N.C. We'd like you to run for Peter's seat. As you probably know, the election's been set for the first week of February.

You want me to run?

With your stature(名望，声望；身高) in the community, your grass roots organizing experience...

Christina, hold on.

I know it's a lot to consider.

It's only been a month.

Well, we still have to govern, Paul.

I thought you asked me down here because you wanted to talk or something.

I do. About the election.

I mean about Peter.

How come you didn't go to the funeral(葬礼，丧礼；<美>葬礼上的布道)?

I couldn't.

How you been holding up?

I'm all right. It's been hard keeping the office on track.

Jesus. Screw the office.

What about you?

You're allowed to grieve(感到悲痛；使伤心), Christina.

Paul...

there are 600,000 people counting on us.

I can't let my feelings get in the way of that.

Will you hear me out about running for Peter's seat?

Well, you've passed the vetting process with flying colors.

Is there anything we might have missed? 

No, sir.

Tell me about your experience as the chair of the oversight(监督；失察，疏忽) reform committee.

It's been very rewarding(值得的，有意义的；赚钱的，营利的).

What are the biggest challenges you've had to face?

Partisanship.

Well, I suppose a room filled with 435 big egos(自负，自尊，自我意识；（心理学）自我) isn't the most hospitable(好客的，热情友好的；环境适宜的；乐于接受的) place for oversight.

Do you want to be Vice President, Tabitha?

It would be a great honor, sir.

We'll be in touch.

That's all?

For the time being.(暂时眼下) 

Thank you, Mr. President.

We have to cross her off.

I agree. She could put a crack(破裂，裂开；崩溃) addict(使上瘾，使沉迷) to sleep.

Then what is she doing on the goddamn list?

Tabitha's a very gifted legislator.

I don't want people who make sense on paper.

I need at least one viable option.

The two of you created this list and have proceeded to cross off every name you've put on it.

It's just a first pass, sir. We need time to fully vet all...

Jim's gonna win this thing in Pennsylvania, and we're no closer to naming his replacement than we were a month ago.

Let us take another crack at it and give you a few more names to consider.

I just want one name.

We'll have something for you by tomorrow morning.

Thank you, Mr. President.

He's ready to say yes to anything.

Yeah, for this to work, I don't think you can be there.

Not when I first mention it. 

I agree. You bring it up in your morning brief, and when I show up, I'll act surprised.

Assuming he's open to the idea...

look, all we have to do tomorrow is plant the notion(概念，想法；缝纫用品；一时的念头，突发的奇想) in his head. I'm sure you'll be persuasive(有说服力的，能使人信服的).

Hello? Mr. Capra?

Yeah. Who's this?

Janine Skorsky from Slugline. We spoke when I wrote the piece about Congressman Russo's passing.

I'm done giving interviews about Peter, okay? He was a troubled guy. End of story.

This is not about his death. I'm calling you because my sources at the D Triple C are telling me that you might be running for his seat.

I'm not talking about that.

But you did have a meeting this morning with Christina Gallagher, correct?

I'm driving right now. I really shouldn't be on the phone.

If you do run, I would like to know about your involvement in the closing of the Philadelphia shipyard.

That decision was made in Washington. The association wasn't consulted(咨询，请教；商量，商讨；查询，查阅；当顾问).

Forgive me. I find that hard to believe. I read all of the transcripts from the BRAC Commission. Congressman Russo didn't give any testimony. So are you saying that he didn't consult with you once before you...

somebody was strong-arming(使用暴力的；有体力的) him, okay? It was politics.

Do you know who would've pressured(紧迫的；感受压力的) him?

Look, I don't know. He just said people up the food chain.

Did he say anything more specific about...

There's traffic. I gotta go.

Mr. Capra, I would...

should I be perpared to do press?

If he's amenable(有责任的：顺从的，服从的；有义务的；经得起检验的).

What do you think our chances are?

Better than 50-50, if I had to say.

We won't announce until after Matthews wins, though.

I hate to admit it, but I'm nervous(神经紧张的，担忧的).

So am I.

It's just the last time, we found ourselves...

that's my fear too.

All right. You call me, either way.(不管怎样；无论哪种方式)

In no more than nine hours.

Linda's been in there far too long. If the President takes this much convincing(使确信，使信服；说服，劝服), it doesn't bode(预示；为……的兆头) well. I can feel it...his hesitation(犹豫，不情愿) on the other side of that door. I know it's pointless to worry until I know what cards I'm holding. Perhaps he just got interrupted by some...

he wants to tap Raymond Tusk.

What? 

He thinks it's a bold(大胆自信的，敢于冒险的；冒失的，鲁莽的；明显的，轮廓突出的；粗体的，黑体的；<文>陡峭的) idea.

It's an idiotic(十分愚蠢的，白痴般的) idea. The man's never held(握住（hold的过去分词）；举起,抬起；使升高；展示；提出(作为榜样)(后与as连用)) public office.

That's one of the things the President said he likes about him.

The President wants to nominatema multibillionaire in a struggling(奋斗，努力；搏斗，扭打，挣扎脱身) economy? He'll alienate(使疏远，使敌对；使格格不入；转让，让渡（财产或权利）) half the country.

Which is exactly what I said, but he made it very clear he does not want me to fight him on this.

So you didn't mention me at all? 

I never had the chance. His mind was made up before I could say a word.

Well, we have to unmake it.

Well, you can try, but if you do, my guess is he's gonna cut you out of the process altogether(完全地；总共；总之). He seemed adamant(固执的，坚强的；坚定不移的；坚硬无比的). We should go in there.

Mr. President. Morning, Frank.

Will you give us a few minutes, Linda?
能让我们单独谈
Of course.

Linda fill you in?

I think Raymond Tusk is an exciting(令人兴奋的，令人激动的), bold(大胆自信的，敢于冒险的；冒失的) idea.

Well, I'm glad you agree. 

Linda didn't think so.

He's a proven businessman. Brilliant(巧妙的，使人印象深的), but down-to-earth. Do you know him personally?

I met him briefly(简短地，简要地；短暂地，暂时地) once at a fundraiser.

Last night when I called him was the first time we had a meaningful conversation.

Did he seem open to the idea?

I sensed(感觉到，觉察到；（机器）检测出) a good deal of reluctance(不情愿，勉强；（物理）磁阻). He wanted a few days to consider.

Well, good. That gives us time to start vetting him.

He's clean. I had him vetted last yearmwhen I was considering him for Secretary of the Treasury(财政部；大量珍品，宝藏).

And did he say why he's reluctant?

No. Didn't give a reason. Just wanted to mull(研磨；思索或思考某事物；使醉) it over.

I want to send someone to St. Louis to speak to him in person, convince(使确信，使信服；说服，劝服) him to accept the nomination.

And who are you thinking about?

I'd send Linda, but there's so much work for her to do here,mand, well, she can be abrasive(粗糙的；有研磨作用的；伤人感情的；（声音）刺耳的，难听的) at times.(at times 有时间或不时偶尔)

Yeah, she can be a bit tough.

I want someone with gravitas(（拉）庄严；庄重；庄严的举止). Birch is a possibility, but he's not always been our strongest ally.

I'm not sure I would trust Bob with something like this. I would be happy to go myself, sir. I can use a light touch and give him the respect he deserves.

Good. I'll let his people know you're coming.

Thank you, Mr. President. 

Thank you, Frank.

Tell me, Francis.

It's good we were prepared for anything.

I have to fly to St. Louis tonight.

"Somebody was strong-arming him." and when I asked him who, he said, quote(引用，引述), "People up the food chain." 

It's Washington. Congressmen get strong-armed all the time.

My gut(感情的，本能的) says it was Frank Underwood. He had nothing to do with Russo before the shipyard closing, and then suddenly he's propping(支撑，倚靠) him up?

That doesn't mean he was...

let's cut the bullshit(胡说，屁话) once and for all, Zoe. I know he's been feeding you your stories. I don't want to screw you over, but I'm not gonna stop digging on this.

I won't say he was a source.

But you do know each other.

Show me your notes, and I'll talk to him.

These are the notes from the Capra call. And these are the transcripts from the BRAC hearing. When they got to the Philadelphia shipyard, Russo doesn't say anything.

That's fine. Yeah, I would just put both of them in that file.

Claire, I just got a call from the P.R. office at Sancorp saying they wanted to send a film crew(全体船员，全体机组人员；一组工作人员) to take footage(一组（电影，电视）镜头；（以英尺表示的）尺码，长度) of our filtration(过滤；筛选) project in Botswana.

Right. They're just using that for promotional(促销的，推广的；促销的，推广的) material.

Sancorp fought us on the watershed bill.

They helped us get the filters out of South Sudan.

I thought that was the State Department.

No. You remember Remy Danton? You met him in your office right after you started working here.

The lobbyist. 

I asked him for his help.

We're just returning the favor, that's all.

Claire, they're against everything we stand for.

It's harmless. They'll send the video to a few of their investors(投资者，投资机构) and make some commercials(电视广告，电台广告).

This makes me very uncomfortable... the idea...

They are sending the film crew, Gillian, so please work with them on that.

One of my colleagues is looking into Peter Russo.(look into 调查窥视观察过问), The assumption(假定，假设；取得，承担) is you strong-armed him into closing the shipyard.

Where does your colleague get their information?

I don't know.

Allocating the D.O.D. budget is always a free-for-all.

Did you pressure(对……施加压力，强迫；使……增压) him?

There were certain people that were gonna benefit from the base closing sooner rather than later. I didn't strong-arm Peter. I advised him to trade in a losing hand for a winning one.

How did he stand to win?

He made allies out of enemies. That's a very valuable thing in Congress. I wish I could give you something juicier(多汁的), but the shipyard closing was just politics as usual. I assume your colleague is Ms. Skorsky. Does she know we're talking?

No. Of course not.

Be in touch.

More than you ever wanted to know about Raymond Alan Tusk...the companies he controls, political contributions. A GQ article entitled "Backwoods(未开垦地（偏僻的森林地带）) billionaire" is about his humble(谦虚的，谦卑的) midwestern(中西部的，有中西部特性的) lifestyle. 

Jesus.

There's also a copy of the financial disclosure(披露，泄密；透露的秘闻，公开的事情) requirements and details of the blind(失明的，盲的；未察觉的) trust. I think the trust is where you want to focus.

Could Linda be behind all this?

To what end?

To get you out of town for a few days while they continue the search without your interference(干涉，干预；（收音机或电视机受到的）干扰信号).

The President has no reason to mistrust me.

Unless Linda told him you want the Vice Presidency.

No. She's in way too deep.

We misjudged her on the Secretary of State nomination.

That was different. She blindsided(出其不意地袭击；（使）遭受意外的打击；拦腰撞上) me. Now she knows my eyes are wide open.

Do you want the Gaffney bag or regular business?

Regular business. Tusk can dress down if he wants to, but I'm representing the White House. Oh, and get Walter Doyle onto Tusk.Let's see if we can dig up anything.

I'll call him right now.

And keep your eye on Janine Skorsky while I'm away. She's been prying(撬动，撬开) into Russo.

What does she know?

She knows the right questions to ask. I want to make sure she doesn't get the right answers.

I'm on it.

McCuddin. McCuddin.

What was that?

McCuddin Air Force Base. BRAC hearing. Was there on April 12th. David Rasmussen stepped down less than a week later. Womack takes his place. So maybe...

wait, slow down.

McCudden is in his district.

Is that the shipyard thing?

Janine, call me back. I think it was Womack who pressured Russo. Russo was probably just earning a favor he could cash in later. I'm around.

Did you ever have to fight her to kill a story?

Janine?

Yeah. When she worked for you.

Only when I knew she was wrong.

She's trying to draw up this whole conspiracy(阴谋，密谋；阴谋集团) thing with Russo and Frank Underwood and the whole shipyard closing. But I'm pretty sure she's wrong.

Pretty sure isn't the same as certain. 

No. I am certain.

How do you know? 

I have sources.

Underwood? 

No. No. Never mind. I'll figure it out.

Mrs. Tusk? 

Jean, please. You must be Frank. Come in. So nice to meet you. The guest room is this way.

It is very kind of you to have invited me to stay here.

Why waste the taxpayers' money on a hotel when we have a perfectly good bed?

Well, both they and I are very grateful.

I'm sorry Raymond isn't awake to greet(欢迎，迎接；对……作出反应) you.

He goes to bed at... I know he's an early riser. I understand.

Would you like a wakeup knock?

No. I have an alarm on my phone.

Sleep tight(紧身的，紧贴的；拉紧的，绷紧). (sleep tight 当你熟睡睡个好觉好好睡美美睡上一觉)

Thank you so much.

I would say good morning, but it's the middle of the night. It's a pleasure to meet you. 

And you too.

Was I making too much noise?

No. I smelled bacon.

Here. Coffee? Booze? 2:00 a.m., you can go either way.

Just water for now.

It's filtered. Your wife would approve(同意，赞成；批准，通过；核准；喜欢，赞赏).

You ever been to St. Louis before?

Just the airport.

What do you think so far?

Well, I've only seen your neighborhood and whatever I could see out the window on the interstate(州际的；州与州之间的).

Good enough. It's all pretty much the same.

Excuse me.

Listen, um, I still haven't showered. My mind is on China here.

Uh, what do you say you get a few more zs and we try this again in a few hours with our clothes on?

Sounds like a plan.

Meet me at my office at 9:30. I'll have a driver pick you up.

Can I ask why you do that?

Do what? 

Tap your ring like that.

I've seen you do it on TV.

Two taps every time you get up from a table or leave a lectern(讲台；诵经台).

Something my father taught me.

It's meant to harden your knuckles(关节；指关节；指节；膝关节；肘) so you don't break them if you get into a fight. It also has the added benefit of knocking on wood. My father believed that success is a mixture of preparation and luck. Tapping the table kills both birds with one stone.(一只二鸟)

Your father was a peach farmer?

Yes, he was. Not a very successful one.

Lack of preparation or lack of luck? 

Lack of both. He was better at giving advice than following it.

Miss? Miss, your card.

Thank you.

Ms. Gallagher, my name's Janine Skorsky. I'm a reporter at Slugline.

I wrote the profile on Congressman... I remember.

Do you have a minute?

if this is about Peter, I...

no, it's about Paul Capra. We know that he might be running for Congressman Russo's old seat.

I can't comment on that.

We're just trying to do some background on the shipyard closing last April.

Listen, I just want to eat my breakfast.

We have sources that are saying that the Congressman was being pressured by someone to not fight the closure.

Who? 

That's what I'm trying to figure out. This is completely off the record, I promise you.

Hi, Christina. 

Doug, hi.

How you holding up? 

I'm okay. I'm... I'm good.

I saw you sitting over here. You mind if I...

no, please.

Ms. Skorsky, right? I believe we spoke a few times when you used to work at the Herald.

Whenever I could get past the press office gauntlet(长手套；（古时士兵戴的）金属护手；夹道鞭笞的刑罚；交叉射击；严酷考验) to you.

We do like to run a tight ship.

So what brings you to the Capitol?

I was just asking Ms. Gallagher who's running to fill the vacant(（地方）空着的，无人用的；（职位，工作）空缺的；茫然的，失神的) seat in Pennsylvania's 1st.

Well, the honest answer is we don't know.

Thank you for your time, Ms. Gallagher.

Anyone starts harassing(骚扰；不断攻击（敌人）) you with questions you don't want to answer, you let me know. I'll handle them.

You got enough on your plate right now.

Thanks, Doug. I appreciate that.

Hang in there, okay?

Yes. Uganda, Peru, Nepal, Indonesia, Nicaragua.

Well, you are quite the well traveled man.

No. I'm the man who stays at home.

Jean brought those back for me.

Mr. Tusk, I am... 

First names.

after all, w have broken bacon together. We can safely assume(假定，假设，认为；装出，做出) that we're familiar.

Raymond, I realize that you are a very busy man, so I'm gonna cut right to the chase(追赶，追逐；争取).

The President sincerely(由衷地，真诚地) would like you to become the next Vice President.

That part I already knew.

And I'm here to convince you to say yes.

Another thing I already knew.

Well, I don't know that I can tell you anything you don't already know.

But perhaps you can tell me what your hesitation(犹豫，不情愿) is.

Speak.

Yes.

Now, I understand you might have some concerns(担心，忧虑) about the financial disclosures(披露，泄密；透露的秘闻，公开的事情) leading...

speak.

No.

I have eight people representing me at eight simultaneous(同时发生的，同步的) meetings in six time zones right now. I sit here and answer their questions, provided they come in the form of a single yes or no proposition(主张，观点).

Well, then, let me give that a try. Would you like to be the Vice President? Yes or no?

Hold on a minute.

I am very sorry. Let me have 20 minutes to wrap up these meetings.

And then what do you say we get out of the office and away from this damn phone? Meet me at my car. Betty can tell you where it's parked.

Go ahead.

He's deflecting(使转向；使偏斜；使弯曲). (他在回避)

What I can't tell is whether it's because he's inclined(倾向于；点头；（使）倾斜；赞同（某人，某事）) to say no or wants to be wooed(追求；招致；向……求爱；恳求) to say yes. Either way, I'll have to ease him into the conversation, not be so blunt(钝的，不锋利的；直言不讳的，说话生硬的). This trip may take longer than I thought.

We've looked through all the file cabinets(内阁；储藏柜，陈列柜).

They're not on his computer?

Not with the Congressman's handwritten notes.

All right. I'll check his office.

There is a comfort(舒服，舒适；安慰) to these woods. Like they're my backyard(后院；后庭). Well, they are my backyard, in a way. I own them.

How much land?

Six thousand acres.

You think I could get a tour of your Fulton plant while I'm in town? 

If you'd like. But...I don't know why you'd want to be there when you could be out here.

I've never seen a nuclear plant(植物；工厂，发电厂).

Not much to see.

Steel, concrete(混凝土), a lot of steam.

The President hasn't exactly been a big supporter of nuclear power.

Is that, uh, part of your hesitation...that fear that the administration...

he's just being savvy(理解，懂).

Nuclear energy is a tough sell after Japan. But it's the only option we have right now that doesn't completely trash(损坏，毁坏) the planet. The argument against nuclear power is an emotional one.

And you don't make decisions based on emotion.

Decisions based on emotion aren't decisions at all. They're instincts([生物]本能（instinct 的复数）；[心理]直觉), which can be of value.The rational(合理的，基于理性的) and the irrational complement(补充，补足) each other. Individually(分别地，单独地), they're far less powerful.

And which category do your thoughts on the vice presidency fall into?

Do you hear that song? It's a hermit(隐士，隐居者；蜂鸟) thrush(画眉；[口腔]鹅口疮；蹄叉腐疽). Can't see him.

"Solitary(独自的，单独的；偏僻的), the thrush. The hermit, withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements(协议，和解；定居点，聚居地), sings by himself a song."

Do you know the poem(诗，韵文)? 

No, I don't.

It's Walt Whitman. It's about the death of Abraham Lincoln. He's over there somewhere.

Yes, I know the damn poem. We studied it at the Sentinel.

I said to my Professor, "Why mourn(悼念，哀悼；对……感到痛心（遗憾）) the death of Presidents, or anyone for that matter? The dead can't hear us." And he asked me if I believed in heaven. I said no. And then he asked if I had no faith in God. I said, "You have it wrong. It's God who has no faith in us." Deeper into the woods.

I think you're being paranoid(多疑的，妄想的；患偏执症的，患妄想症的).

He came up right after I sat down. It was creepy(<非正式>怪异的，令人毛骨悚然的；爬行的).

I'm telling you, it was Womack.

Is that what Underwood said?

He didn't name names. But who else?

What's the big deal? Congressmen trade favors.

One of these congressmen committed suicide.

I think you're stretching here, Janine. To try and connect...

I have gone after big fish before. I know what it feels like to be watched.

Underwood's education bill went to the floor just three days after Womack became majority leader. You leaked the education bill. And then there was the Kern article.

Those were two completely different stories.

Wait. What was the guy?

Uh, what was his name? He's the one who told that Kern wrote the article for the school paper.

Roy Kapeniak. 

You should go talk to him.

There's no link. 

Except you.

Underwood's been using you, Zoe.

Don't you want to know why?
 
Remy Danton's on line two. He says it's important.

Hello, Remy. 

Hey, Claire.

I got a call from the P.R. Team at Sancorp. They said Gillian Cole isn't being cooperative(合作的，协作的；乐于配合的).

Hasn't gotten back to them, you mean?

No. Told them point-blank(直接地直射的正面地直线地) she doesn't want the film crew there.

I'm looking at an email. She wrote that they would be disruptive(引起混乱的，破坏的；创新的，开拓性的) to the project and local community.Is that her, or is that coming from you?

No. I made it very clear that I wanted her to work with them.

Well, it seems like she's doing the opposite(完全相反的，截然不同的；相反的，另一边的).

I will speak to her, and then I'll sort things out with the P.R. Team personally.

Thank you, Claire. 

You bet.(不客气)

Is Gillian at lunch?

She didn't come in yet today. She's not feeling well.

Let me know when she gets here.

What time is your flight? 

6:40.

We should get going. There's gonna be traffic.

Almost ready.

I've been thinking. The, uh, older man you were with. Was it Underwood?

So, what this is really about is covering your own ass.

That is not true.

You don't want anybody to know you were sleeping with him.

Not exactly objective reporting, is it?

Don't fucking lecture(讲座，讲课，演讲；训斥，告诫) me on journalistic ethics(行为准则，道德原则；伦理学，道德学).

How many of the stories you brought me at the herald were because you were...

I'm not gonna have this conversation.

Fine. Maybe you should take a cab to the airport.

Don't punish me for being honest.

You haven't been honest. I had to ask. And you still haven't given me a straight answer.

Yes. It was him.

I... I don't know if I can do this, Zoe.

Do what? 

You fucked a Congressman to get ahead.

I'm not the first person to ever do something like that, Lucas.

But I'm not sleeping with those other people, am I?

What, so you just hate me now?

No. I probably love you. That's the fucking problem.

Let's go. I'm parked illegally.

So I hear you went stomping(尤指生气时）跺脚，重踩；跳顿足舞) through the woods today.

We did, and then Raymond was kind enough to arrange a tour of the Fulton plant. 

And I'm sure you were wondering, "When is this old fool gonna get around to brass tacks?"

I'm here to simply answer questions.

I figured(（以重要地位）出现；<美，非正式>认为，估计；理解，弄懂；计算；用图画（或图形等）描绘，想象) that you would make up your mind when you're ready.

There are two minds here.

We know all about the blind trust.

Does it concern either of you?

The words "Blind" And "Trust" are not among my favorites in the English language. But I have no problem with it in theory(学说，理论；（某一学科基于的）理论，原理；观点，见解).

Not managing our assets for a few years could unburden(吐露；卸去……的负担) us from a great deal of stress(精神压力，紧张；压力，应力；强调，重要性).

Well, then, what does your reluctance(不情愿，勉强；（物理）磁阻) stem(（植物、灌木的）茎，干；（高脚酒杯的）柄脚) from?

Why do you think the President wants me?

Well, I can't speak on his behalf, but if I were to...

aren't you here to do just that... speak on his behalf?

yes, If I were to speculate(猜测，推测；投机), I think the President would prob...

speculation is a poot form of investment and an equally(相当地，同样地；平均地，相等地；（用于补充观点）同样) poor form of politics.

Tell me what you know.

I don't know what you mean.

Well, what do you think I should do?

You, personally, Frank Underwood?

My opinion isn't what matters here.

It does to me. Should I do it? Yes or no?

Well, there's a great number of things to consider...

And I'm sure you've considered them all. come on, Yes or no, Frank?

No, I will not answer that question.

Because you think I shouldn't.

Because it's not relevant(有关的，切题的；正确的，适宜的；有价值的，有意义的).

All right, then. Let me ask you another way. Would you take the job?

It hasn't been offered to me.

What if it were?

I have a distaste(反感，不喜欢) for hypotheticals(（基于）假设的，假定的) just the same as you have a distaste for speculation.

All right, all right. That's enough business for now. We can discuss it more tomorrow.

Get in. Get in there, Bruce.

Sorry. Sorry to bother you, ma'am. Um, I'm looking for Roy Kapeniak. I thought his trailer(拖车，挂车；（卡车或货车的）载货挂车) was over here. Am I in the right place?

You're in the right place a month ago.

He got evicted(驱逐).

He was shootin' off his gun too much in the yard.

Do you know where I can find him?

Why?

I'm a relative. His... his niece(外甥女，侄女).

Skipped town is what I heard.

Had a girl livin' with him. Maybe she knows.

Name was Echo. Echo?

That's what she went by, at least.

Works at the titty(乳房，乳头（等于 teat）) bar over on 40.

Highway 40?

Across from the Burger King. 

Okay. Thank you.

Girls get in free.

I'm looking for Echo. 

Who?

Echo.

Roy was a fucking wacko(疯子；怪人). I was stupid to live with him as long as I did.

Do you know where he is now? 

I don't know, and I don't care.

He ever talk about the article I wrote?

All the time. He had it framed(装框架；勾勒出；围绕). Bet it's still in the trailer if it's not in a junkyard(废品堆放场；旧汽车丢弃的地方) right now.

Did he say why he called me?mDid he ever tell you? 

I was there.

Where? 

When the guy showed up.

Who?

I won't name names. Fuck Roy Kapeniak. You don't owe him shit.

Some guy who said he was a Congressman.

Was it...

No.

He was younger, tall, not much hair, pretty goodlooking.

Yeah, that was him. 

You're absolutely sure?

He brought bourbon(波旁威士忌酒), blow(<非正式>大麻), stayed the whole night. The whole thing was his idea.

What, to say that Kern wrote the editorial?

That guy didn't write anything. It was all Roy.

Okay, look, I know I said that I wouldn't name names, and I won't if that's what you want. But you could be famous overnight. Talk shows, TV, the whole country...

no way.

You wouldn't have to dance anymore. You could do whatever you want.

Don't use my fucking name, okay? I already said more than I should have.

Stamper, it's midnight. Two things, boss.

First, Janine Skorsky ambushed(伏击，埋伏) Christina this morning. I intercepted(拦截，阻截；抄截) her before she could ask too much.

Should we be worried? 

I can keep this contained, sir.

I just wanted you to know.

All right. What's the other thing?

Doyle came back with his research. I just emailed it to you.

The President told you he and Tusk didn't know each other, right?

Yeah. He said they met once, I think, at a fundraiser.

That would appear to be a lie.

All right. I have it in front of me now.

Doyle catalogued(列入目录，编入目录；列举，记载) all the instances he could find in which the two of them were in the same city at the same time. Items in red are events that they both attended(参加；注意；照料). And he found something else. Back in Walker's private sector(区域，部分；（尤指商业、贸易等的）部门，行业) days, he was the C.E.O. of Pioneer(拓荒者；先锋) Airlines. Guess who owned a third of the stock when it was sold to united?

Raymond Tusk.

My guess is that he and Walker know each other quite well.

All right. Let me look this over. I'll call you back.

I'm being played. But why?

Did I wake you again? 

No. I'd like to talk.

Give me a moment.

Carolina Parakeet(长尾小鹦鹉).

You're wrong, but you're close. This is the Sun Conure. They look very similar, but the Carolina Parakeet is extinct(灭绝的；消亡的), Was killed off because it was considered a pest(害虫，有害动物；<非正式>讨厌的人（或物）). Interesting species(种，物种；种类), though. Voracious(贪婪的；贪吃的) appetite(食欲，胃口；欲望，爱好). And he was poison(毒药；有害的思想). Cats who ate him died.

This bird is not the only thing you've misidentified(识别错) since you've been in St. Louis.

You and Walker are old friends. I wasn't sent here to vet you.

Very good.

Tell me why I am here, then.

So I can vet you.

For the vice presidency?

The President values my advice, and he tends to follow it.

Like when I advised him not to make you Secretary of State.

That was very bad advice.

Yes, it was. One of the larger mistakes I've made, and I very rarely make mistakes of any size. You've proven yourself to be quite difficult. Kern, the teachers' strike, now Matthews.

You attribute(把……归因于；认为是……所作；认为……具有某种特质) all that to me?

If I had to guess.

A smart man once said to me that speculation is a poor form of politics.

Why don't you stick(粘，贴；铭记在心，经久不忘) to what you know, Raymond?

What I know is you are extremely effective(产生预期结果的，有效的；实际的，事实上的) at what you set your mind to. That is valuable to me, and I've already told Garrett that it could be valuable to him. somebody at his side with one foot in the executive branch and one in the legislative. He is very open to the idea.

My turn to speculate. Your recommendation comes at a price.

Fact.

I have something that you want. You have something that I want. Have I said something amusing(逗人发笑的，有趣的)?

Oh, I've just sat too many times on your side of the table not to enjoy the irony(（出乎意料的）奇异可笑之处，具有讽刺意味的情况；反语，讽刺) of finding myself on this side of it.

Would you like to hear what I want?

I don't shackle(束缚；桎梏；脚镣) myself to people I don't know.

What I want is one favor. One and only one.

Which is?

I need to be certain you'll grant(授予，给予；承认) it before I'll take the risk of being more special.

A blank check.

of sorts.

you would never grant anyone a blank check.

no, but I'm not sitting on that side of the table. we still believe in handshakes where I come from. do they still mean anything in Washington? who are you calling?

car service to get me to the airport.

Frank, I will tell the president that I want until Friday to think things over before I make m recommendation. let me know if you change your mind. and let me arrange the car for you.

Hi, I'd like to arrange a car, please.

how are you feeling?

better than yesterday. but I might take off early if, uh, the nausea(恶心，呕吐感；极端的憎恶) comes back.

I find it interesting that you stay home the day after you blow off the scancrop people. you weren't feeling sick, Gillian.

I find it extremely offensive(无礼的，冒犯的；令人不快（讨厌）的) that you'd accuse(控告，指控；指责，谴责，归咎于) me of hiding behind my pregnancy(怀孕（期），妊娠（期）).

you knew what I wanted.

the Botswana project is mine.

under my umbrella, using money I raised.

you promised me autonomy(自治，自治权；独立自主，自主权).

um, excuse us for a moment, please. I promised to enpower(授权，允许；使能够) you, that's not the same thing as you doing as you choose without consulting(咨询，请教；商量，商讨；查询) me.

I'm not gonna allow a project I've put almost three years of my life into...

your project wouldn't be happening if it weren't for sancrop.

I didn't ask for their help. how about consulting me before you struck(打，撞；（用手或武器等）打) a deal?

let's get something very clear, I run the Organization, you work for it.

our agreement is an affiliation(（与政治、宗教等组织的）联系，从属关系；加盟，加入), Claire. worldwell isn't your vassal(诸侯；封臣).

yes, it it, entirely(完全地，完整地；仅仅，只). if we're going to be blunt about it.

that's not what you proposed six month ago.

it's what you signed up for when you signed the contract.

there was a good faith understanding that...

and you dissolved(溶解的，溶化的) that good faith by disobeying me.

disobeying you?

yes.

I threaten you, didn't I?

nothing about you threatens me. but maybe you should take a leave of absence(缺席，缺勤，不在；缺乏，没有；缺席期间，休假期间；不注意).

are you firing me?

that's up to you, but right now you should leave.

did you get her on record?

no, she wouldn't talk to me otherwise(否则，不然；除此以外).

we need hard proof that Underwood was behind it.

this whole thing is making me really nervous.

that you'll be exposed?

not that, it's Francis. if this really goes as deep as we think, and he's already watching you.

you think he's dangerous?

I know he is.

but that's why we have to keep going.

he crushes(压坏，挤压变形；捣碎，碾成粉末) people.

hey, Callum.

hey.

look, if you weren't afraid, you wouldn't be doing your job. the only articles that I have ever written that truly mattered scared(使惊恐，吓唬；害怕，恐惧) the shit out of me. we need to know about anything that might've happened with Russo. something Underwood could have held over him.

we have to go back to Christina Gallagher. see if she'll give us something.

it can't be me. if I go back for a second time.

I'll do it.

You honestly had no idea that the precedent and Tusk were close?

he never showed up once on any call sheet, phone log or schedule during the campaign or since we've been in office.

I'd love to believe you, Linda, but I finding it very difficult.

what would I gain(获得，赢得；受益；增加) by keeping you in the dark. I am as shocked as you are, Frank.

well, don't let on that you know.

of course not.

what's the president saying?

he wants to meet with you Tuesday to get your report on Tusk.

that's a farce(荒唐的事情，闹剧；滑稽戏（剧本），闹剧（剧本）).

should I come up with a reason to delay the meeting?

no, maybe we'll learn something. what time?

2:00 P.M.

all right, I'll be there, thank you, Linda.

we have one week.

to accomplish what exactly?

to force Tusk's hand. he wants me beholden(负有义务的；蒙恩的；对……表示感谢的) to him. no. we have to make him come crawling(爬，爬行，匍匐行进) to me.

what's his weakness?

his fortune(财富，巨款；未来).

wouldn't you say that's his strength(体力，力量；实力，影响力；长处，优势)?

not if it's slipping away.

how do you make 40 billion disappeare overnight(在夜间，在晚上；突然，一夜之间)?

we can't. but maybe we can create the illusion(错觉，幻觉；幻想，错误的观念) that it's in danger. the brief you gave me on his assets. how much of his total net worth is... in nuclear power?

about a third. sixteen reactors here in the states, 37 worldwide.

well, that's what we hit him with. we go after his nuclear interests(利益，好处；权益，股权).

even so, he's got 25 billion in other investments.

Doug, this is a man who built his fortune from nothing. the money doesn't mean anything to him, it's what it represents.

whick is what?

his life's work. get Remy Danton on the phone. set up a meeting as quickly as you can.

you got it.

Tusk understands the difference between power and money. that's precisely what makes him dangerous. he doesn't measure his wealth in private jets(喷气式飞机；喷射流；煤玉). but purchased(<正式>购买，采购) souls. I've worked too hard to get within arm's reach of the prize, only to have my hand cut off just before I seize(抓住，捉住；（用武力）夺取，占领；逮捕) it.

Zoe Barnes, here to see Christina Gallagher.

I'm sorry, I don't see an appointment.

oh, there must be a mistake. I have an 11:30.

one second.

my name is Zoe Barnes. I work at Slugline, you spoke to my colleague Janine Skorsky.

miss...

oh we're fine. thanks.

you can't jsut come in here.

there are something you don't know about Peter. I wrote the article about Roy Kapeniak,

please leave, right now.

it was Peter who convinced him to talk to me.

what, I don't...I don't understand. why would he...

somebody presured him to do it. the night of January 24th. that's when he went to speak to Kapeniak, do you remember anything strange around the tiem of the inauguration. anything that could have been held over him?

no, I don't.

if he was mixed up in things that in any way contributed to his suicide. wouldn't you want to know? I'm not trying to cause you any more pain. I just want the truth. and you deserve that more than anyone.

what was the date?

the 24th of January.

### Chapter 13

What was that?

The faucet(<美>水龙头，旋塞). It wouldn't shut up.

Did you sleep last night? 

No.

I'll call Nancy and tell her to call a plumber(水管工人，水电工).

Absolute discretion(自行决定权，判断力；谨慎，慎重). Can I count on that?

Always. 

Raymond Tusk. The President wants to tap him as the new V.P. You and I cannot let that happen. 

Why not?

Because a third of his fortune is tied up in nuclear energy.

Sancorp does not want a pro-nuclear businessman in the White House.

The market is shifting toward natural gas anyway.

But Tusk wants to stall(熄火，抛锚；故意拖延) that shift or reverse it.

Vice President doesn't have that kind of influence.

This one would. He and Walker are very close. And it's in neither of our best interests to seep(渗漏，渗透；逐渐移动，渐渐散开) Sancorp's position in the marketplace diminished(减弱的；减退了的).

What's the ask? 

Tusk won't accept the nomination if he thinks his holdings are at risk.

Sancorp needs to initiate(开始实施，发起；使了解) a hostile(敌对的，怀敌意的；强烈反对的) takeover(接管；验收).

He's worth three times what sancorp is.

I'm talking about the subsidiaries(子公司；下属公司).

We go after the companies that refine(精炼，提纯；改进，改善) and ship the uranium(（化学元素）铀), the support system that... 

Come on, Frank.

there's stockholders to take into account, a huge financial exposure(暴露，接触；曝光，揭发).

We just need to distract(使分心，使转移注意力；<古>使困惑，使迷惑) him. Send a few token salvos(齐射；齐鸣；齐声欢呼喝彩；保留条款；遁辞) and intimate(透露，暗示；宣布，通告) there's more to come. All I'm asking is that you speak to your client and see if this is something they might be willing to consider.

The President announces Tusk on Friday, so we don't have a lot of time.

I'll make some calls. 

Thank you, Remy.

If he doesn't deliver, I'm an invader(侵略者，侵略军) without an army. If he does, I've got a fighting chance.

I just didn't feel that we could work together constructively(建设性地) any longer. I think that's a perfectly legitimate(正当的，合理的；合法的，依法的) reason...

Of course it is. But what you can't do is fire someone for being pregnant(怀孕的，妊娠的；意味深长的，意义重大的).

Is that what she's saying?

Ms. Cole claims that you said, quote, "I need employees, not mothers," and, quote, "go focus on your baby."

Can I see that?

That's completely false. I...I never said that.

She claims(声称，断言；索取) you did.

It's her word against mine, right?

Well, juries are very sympathetic(同情的，有同情心的；赞同的) with expecting mothers.

This is extortion(勒索；敲诈；强夺；被勒索的财物).

We don't want this going to trial(审判，审理；试验，试用), Claire. You and your husband are public figures. This will result in some very bad press. I suggest we go back to them with a settlement(解决争端的）协议，和解；定居点) offer.

We need the arrest record. 

There isn't any. They let him go. 

Then we need to know who got him off.

If Underwood was involved, we are talking abuse(虐待；滥用，辜负；辱骂；糟蹋（某物）；性侵犯) of powers and corruption(贪污，腐败；堕落，腐蚀；（电脑上资讯的）破坏，损坏).

I checked. There's no files, no mug(大杯，马克杯；一大杯的容量；<非正式>（人的）脸) shot(一张照片，（电影的）一组镜头; 射击，开枪), nothing.

Then we need to find the cop(警察；管纱，纬管) who pulled him over, or somebody who saw him come into the station. But D.C. cops... they look after each other.

we need to be careful.

Do you have any sources on the force?

Not that I would trust with something like this.

You know, Lucas started out on the crime beat. I can see if he knows anyone.

Would he help us? 

I don't know. Maybe. 

Help out a competitor(竞争者，对手；选手，参赛者)?

We... stayed in touch.

you've gotta be kidding me. this town is way too incestuous(乱伦的；血亲相奸的；犯乱伦罪的).

I know it's a lot to ask.

I'm still trying to wrap(包，裹，包装；用（手臂、指头或腿）围紧) my head around the affair(公共事务，政治事务；事情，事件), Zoe.

If you could just give me a contact(联系，联络；接触，触摸；联络人) and maybe vouch(担保；证明；传出庭作证) for me...

did you wait to bring this up until now because you thought it'd be harder for me to say no?

What do you mean? 

In bed, right after we...

You don't actually think I would do something like...

It sure seems that way. 

This is huge, Lucas.

I'm trying to avoid fucking up what we have... Whatever that is... and you're making it really hard for me.

I don't know that I'll ever be the kind of person that makes it easy.

I'm not looking for easy. But I don't need to be reminded of him.

I can't erase what I did. 

I know you can't. But this is really fucking manipulative(操纵的，善于摆布（他人）的；熟练操作的，有操作能力的；推拿的).

Did you mean what you said the other night? That you probably...I don't know what to do when I hear something like that. That's why I was so quiet when you drove me to the airport.

I was angry. I just blurted(未加思索地冲口说出；突然说出) it out. I wish I hadn't. At least not like that.

I'm not trying to take advantage(有利条件，优势；优点；利益) of you because you did.(take advantage of 利用占便宜欺负趁)

He hasn't said a word. 

And you haven't brought it up?

I just asked him if he was still considering Tusk.

He said yes, but that he wanted to speak to you first. That's it.

I wish we knew if they'd spoken at all.

Well, he has a private line. I can't track those calls.

Frank. Mr. President. Tell me about St. Louis.

He's a hard man to read. I did my best to probe(调查，打探，探究) him, but I don't think I left any wiser(聪明的；贤明的) to which way he's leaning.

I must say, though, I think he is by far and away the best candidate(候选人，申请者；有望体验).

Why do you say that?

Doesn't it make sense for you to nominate someone you know so well?

I don't know him. That's why I sent you to St. Louis.

Forgive me, Mr. President. I didn't mean it that way. I meant that the world knows so well. You, me, everyone knows Raymond Tusk. We don't need to convince(使确信，使信服；说服，劝服) anyone of his worthiness.

But you said he still seems ambivalent(（感情、态度等）矛盾的)?

Which is why I think you should make a personal overture(前奏曲；提案；序幕). Invite him to the White House.

Well, I don't want to appear desperate(不顾一切的，拼命的；极需要的，渴望的).

I agree with Frank. Inviting him is a very good idea.

If you're serious about Tusk, you should wine and dine(进餐，吃饭；宴请) him. Make him feel very special.

I'm sure we can find time in the schedule.

Let's give him a few more days. 

We have less than a week, sir. I wouldn't wait any later than Friday.

We can make Friday work, sir.

All right. Well, let's see if he's available.

What are you doing? 

Shh.

Give me your phone. 

Why?

Just give it to me.

Have you noticed anything weird(奇怪的，不寻常的；怪异的，超自然的) in here?

Stuff moved around? Anything missing?

No. Anyone following you?

What did you find out?

This is serious, Zoe. It goes way up, as high as the commissioner(（政府部门的）首长，长官；（委员会的）委员，专员；警察局局长). I had to beg my contact at Metro to give me this.

No record of Russo getting pulled over, but he remembers there was a call girl brought in with Russo. That's a file on one of her previous arrests. I've investigated police cover-ups before. I got death threats(威胁，恐吓；构成威胁的人（或事物）；凶兆，征兆；（律）恐吓，威胁) for a year. Are you willing to take that risk?

Yeah.

How long?

The next board of directors meeting is three weeks from now.

That is too late. Remy, look, the President is gonna nominate Tusk in a week or less. 

I've urged Scott Cunningham to call a special meeting, but that doesn't happen overnight.

There's a lot of machinery(机器，机械（尤指大型机械）；体系，机制；运转部份，装置) in a corporate attack(批评，抨击；侵蚀，侵害；全力应对，奋力处理；袭击，攻击；（体育比赛中）进攻) like this.

I want to meet Scott Cunningham myself.

I'm not sitting you down with Scott. You know the rules.

These are extraordinary(异乎寻常的，令人惊奇的；非凡的) circumstances(环境，状况；（尤指经济上的）境况).

Frank, Sancorp's officers do not meet with politicians, period(一段时间，时期；（人生或国家历史的）阶段，时代).

You talk to me, I talk to Scott Cunningham, and vice versa.(vice versa 反之亦然小爸爸大儿子反过来亦然反之) That's how it works.

All right, Remy. Whatever you think best.

I'll call you when I know more.

Nancy! Of all the things I hold in high regard(<正式> 尊重，敬佩；<正式> 关心，关注), rules are not one of them. I will not place my fate(命运) solely(单独地，仅有地) in the hands of the middleman if I can go directly to the supplier.  Book a flight to Atlanta. Tomorrow morning. Let Meechum know.

Yes, sir.

She grew up in Lynchburg, Virginia, went to Lorimer High School until she dropped out sophomore(<美>（高中或大学的）二年级学生；有两年经验的人) year, and then after that, there's no public record. But all it says here is that she was fined $300 for loitering(流浪罪；街头滞留罪) on April 2012. One of us has to go to Lynchburg. Parents, classmates, teachers... 

I'll do it.

okay, well, then, you and I have to call escort(护送者，护卫队，护航舰) services.

I'm willing to lend a hand, but not by making cold calls 12 hours a day just to get hung up on by hookers.

Where was she arrested?

Connecticut ave. 

2460.

That's the address of the district grand(壮丽的，堂皇的；宏伟的，宏大的) hotel.

I'm not a fan of surprise visits, Frank.

Remy wouldn't arrange a meeting.

Remy Danton exists so we don't have to meet.

I needed to speak with you.

There's a congressional travel report that puts you on a trip to Atlanta the same day I was pulled out of an investors' briefing.Those are the sort of coincidences(巧合，同时发生；相符，一致；符合) we want to avoid.

Were you briefing your investors on Raymond Tusk?

Meechum can be trusted.

Why would I be speaking to them about Tusk?

I thought Remy filled you in. 

No.

He didn't say anything about the vice presidential nomination?

He didn't. And I feeling I'd rather not be told.

Trust me, you want to know.

I've appeared in front of grand juries([法]陪审团（jury 的复数）；评委会) before, Frank. It's much easier when you can tell the truth. Please, don't put me in a position where I have to lie.

If Tusk has the President's ear, you will see this administration shift its support toward nuclear energy and away from natural gas.

His subsidiaries and his suppliers. Go after them.

Frank, we should end this conversation right now.

He will not accept the nomination if his assets are in a blind trust and he can't fight off the threat(威胁，恐吓；构成威胁的人（或事物）；凶兆，征兆；（律）恐吓，威胁).

Okay, we're done. 

Scott...

I don't wanna hear another word. Go back to the airport. Figure out a good reason you needed to be in Atlanta today. You can pull over at the next corner. I'll have my car pick me up.

one last one?

another.

can I get you something?

white wine.

put that on my tab.

thank you.

my pleasure.they're about to call last call.

that's all right, I don't have much of a tolerance(忍受，容忍；（痛苦、困难等的）忍受程度，忍耐力；耐药力，耐受性；公差，容许偏差).

one more?

no, I'm good.

you should head upstairs.

I was waiting for you.

is that the new faucet(<美>水龙头，旋塞)?

yeah. how'd it go?

not good. Remy's up to something. he's not returning my phone calls.

what can I do?

tell me what you were dreaming.

oh, it was so awful, Francis.

he's not letting me sleep either.

yeah, it's not him. it's the kids. I was playing with them in the backyard. and the girl was climbing on the vines(葡萄藤). and I kept telling her to stop and get down, and...The vines just took hold of her, and they wouldn't let go. And she was screaming so loud, and I just kept pulling harder and harder, and she just ripped(（使）撕裂，（使）划破；迅速扯开) in half.

Come here. Come here. Okay.

Jesus!

You wait until after 2:00 in the morning to return my call? You trying to get my voice-mail?(voice-mail 留声邮件)

The conversations we're having we can't be having on cell phones.

Where are you?

Claire is sleeping upstairs.

You shouldn't have gone to see Cunningham.

He says you didn't bring up Tusk.

You really think he'd admit to that?

If we go through with this, it's insider(内部的人，知情人) trading.

He didn't strike me as a man hearing the news for the second time.

You want to believe I'm playing games? I can walk away from the whole thing. But I'm all you've got right now.

I'm the one doing you and Sancorp a favor, not the other way around.

I can tell(看出，确切地判断) when I'm being used, Frank. I just want to know what for. 

I don't use people unless I can throw them away afterwards(以后，后来).

I'm trying to strengthen our partnership.

Smells an awful lot like bullshit(胡说，屁话).

Don't condescend(屈尊；俯就；（对某人）表现出优越感).

Eight years I worked on your staff and never once made it further than your front doorstep. Well, now I'm in your living room, Frank. It's not because of what you taught me, it's because I finally woke up to what my value is and how undervalued I was slaving(
苦干，拼命干；使（装置）从属于（另一装置）) away for you.

This is business. Keep your sob(抽噎（声），呜咽（声）) story to yourself. I want to maintain(保持，维持；维修，保养；断言) the influence that I have worked to achieve(（经努力）达到，取得，实现；获得成功) in the White House, which translates into the influence that you have in the White House, through me.

I'll get in touch with Scott again tomorrow. See if we can push this forward faster.

Thank you, Remy.

But you gotta let me do this my way.

The message was very clear. She doesn't want a settlement, no matter what the figure(数字，数目，数值；数字符号).

Even if we give her worldwell back?

She wants to go to court. They said we can expect a formal summons(召唤；召集（会议）；传唤，传讯) next week. 

This is ludicrous(滑稽的；荒唐的). 

Her lawyers agree.

They'd much prefer a settlement too, but she's not playing ball.

I'll keep pushing them. But in the meantime, you should start gathering all the correspondence(信件，信函；通信；相似，关联) you ever had with her...E-mails, notes, every scrap(（纸、布等的）碎片，小块；丝毫，一丁点) of paper.

Okay. Thanks, Oliver.

All I'm trying to do is find her. I've got an arrest record from April 2012, and I know she was pulled over with a client in January.

That girl. She had so much potential(潜在的，可能的).

Why did she drop out?

Like I said, it's an ethical(道德的，伦理的；合乎道德的) breach(违反，破坏；（关系）中断) for me to discuss anything that has to do...

I spoke to her parents. Her father was very combative(好战的，好争论的). Was there trouble at home?

The father... did he...

I won't speak about Rachel.

Can you talk to me about your job in general, the sorts of cases you deal with in an abstract(抽象的，纯概念的) way?

When I'm concerned(相关的， 关于（某个主题）的；担心的) about a student, especially if there's possible criminal activity involved, it's my duty to contact the D.A.'S office.

Now, if the D.A. Pursues(追求，致力于，执行) charges(费用，价钱；控告，指控), the student has to testify(（通常指在法庭上）作证；证明，证实) against their own parent.

That's a difficult decision for a young person to make.

Extremely difficult. It could be easier to run away.

It's set for tomorrow. Tusk lands at 7:30 and then heads straight to the white house for dinner with the President.

Is it on the official schedule? 

No.

We need it to be. 

Well, I can't do that.

The President specifically asked that I leave it off.

Actually, that's good. We can make that work.

Can you set up a meeting between Birch and the President?

About what?

So he can give him his two cents about who he will nominate.

I don't think we want Birch getting involved.

He'll never get the chance. 

What are you planning?

Can you set up a meeting for later today? Yes or no?

I'm sure I can squeeze(挤压，捏；挤出，榨出) it in.

Good. I'll talk to Birch. Get him on the phone.

This has to stay off the books, just like the dinner with Tusk.

Okay. And finally, do you have a scheduler that you can fire?

Janine, I've got something for you.

What is this?

The President's O.T.R. schedule between now and Friday.

How'd you get this? 

It doesn't matter. Look who he's meeting with this afternoon.

Bob Birch. And look at Friday night.

Raymond Tusk. These aren't the craziest meetings for him to be having.

Then why aren't they on the official schedule?

He's considering them for Vice President.

I'd say that's reason enough to keep them secret.

Get this out, right away.

Mr. speaker, I'm hearing that you're gonna be considered for the vice presidency.

Slugline is reporting that you're heading to the White House right now.

I'm, uh... no. 

You're not headed to the White House?

Yes. The President just wants my input.

But there's the possibility that you might be under consideration yourself.

Not that I'm aware of. Excuse me.

How did the schedule get out? 

It got leaked, sir, by someone in the scheduling office.

On purpose(有意，打算)? 

Accidentally(意外地，偶然地； 意外失误地). A wrong attachment to an e-mail that went wide(广泛地；广阔地；充分地).

Well, whoever it was, I want them out.

I already let them go.

Is, uh, Birch here yet? 

He's waiting outside.

Well, cancel the meeting. Tell him something came up.(come up 走近出现发生上来) I don't want to feed the frenzy(疯狂，狂乱；一阵狂热). 

Yes, sir.

Give me the private line, please.

There are three satellite trucks on my street.

I'm trapped(陷阱，网，夹子；圈套) in my own home.

Somebody in the scheduling office fucked up.

Are you seriously considering Birch?

Absolutely not.

We are losing control of the process, Garrett.

Every time I've spoken to you, you've never spoken back. Although given our mutual(相互的，彼此的；共同的) disdain(鄙视，蔑视), I can't blame you for the silent treatment(对待，待遇；处理，讨论；治疗). Perhaps I'm speaking to the wrong audience. Can you hear me? Are you even capable of language, or do you only understand depravity(堕落；邪恶)? Peter, is that you? Stop hiding in my thoughts and come out. Have the courage in death that you never had in life. Come out, look me in the eye and say what you need to say. There is no solace(安慰；慰藉；安慰之物) above or below. Only us... Small, solitary(独自的，单独的；偏僻的), striving(努力，奋斗；斗争，反抗), battling one another. I pray to myself, for myself.

Hello? Who is it? My lawyer said I shouldn't be talking to you.

Mine said the same thing. 

I'm not gonna change my mind, Claire.

I made a mistake. I got upset, and I acted impulsively(有推动力地).

I was the one who made the mistake by partnering with you in the first place.

Well, then, can we please both admit that it wasn't meant to be, and we can find an amicable(心平气和的，友善的) way...

No, we can't. 

What do you want?

To send a message.

Organizations like yours get 90% of the grant(授予，给予；承认) money, then cozy(使感到舒适，使得意) up to corporate sponsors who destroy the environment.

The things you're claiming are lies.

I never mentioned your pregnancy.

I got in touch with Evelyn Baxter. Remember her? We had a long conversation. It seems that you have a history of axing(削减，撤销；解雇，开除；（用斧）砍) people who disagree with you.

She'll be testifying(（通常指在法庭上）作证；证明，证实) on my behalf(代表（on behalf of）；因为，为了……的利益（in/on behalf of）；就……而言，在……一方（on behalf of）). So will eight of the people that you made her fire.

If you want an apology, I'm here to offer you one, and to give you whatever you think is fair.

This case is gonna get national attention because of who you're married to. I'll have a platform to say what I want to say. That's worth more than anything you could offer.

Listen, I know we have different philosophies(哲学；哲学体系，思想体系), but what we're trying to achieve(达到，取得，实现；获得成功) is exactly the same thing. We shouldn't be fighting each other.

Do you feel that? The kicking? I won't let people like you fuck up the world my child has to live in. If I have to tell a few lies to do that...At least I learned one valuable thing from you.

What can I get for you? 

Glenlivet, neat(整齐的；爱整洁的；巧妙的，简洁的).

The lawsuit(诉讼，诉讼案)?

and other things.

What other things?

You know, I cannot guarantee you that all of this is gonna succeed.

Oh, it's not that.

You can tell me, or I can keep guessing.

You'll roll your eyes.

Not at you.

I was thinking about when one of us dies. Whether it's you first or me...

Well, if it is me, and I'm sure it will be, you won't be alone for long.

No. I mean, what will we leave behind? 

We've accomplished a great deal. And I intend(打算，想要；意指，意思是) for us to accomplish a lot more.

But for whom?

For each other.

But if we're not...Ah, I'm being silly(愚蠢的，傻的；嬉笑滑稽的).

Have you ever been published(出版，发行（书、杂志等）；（作家、 音乐家等）发表（自己的作品），使（作品）出版；（在互联网上）发表；（在报纸或杂志上）刊登)?

Many times.

I guess that's a stupid question. You don't seem like a starving(（使）挨饿，饿死；使极其缺乏，需要) artist.

Don't judge a book by its cover.

You have a nice laugh.

Really?

It's very attractive(吸引人的，有吸引力的；（人）迷人的，有魅力的).

Are you staying at the hotel?

You want to come up to my room?

That depends.

Well, how much would that cost me?

That seems about right.

Close your eyes. Put out your hands. Now open them up. I'm trying to find this woman.

If you make me pull out my badge, I have to take you in. But I don't want to do that. Let's not make a scene.(make a scene 当众大吵大闹)

I used to see her around. She left the business, though. We haven't really kept in touch.

Any idea where she might be?

A friend of mine saw her waiting tables at a restaurant in Georgetown.

I guess the question I'm trying to ask is, um...Is it even worth that step?

The bottom line is that for a woman your age, it's extremely hard.

Have you ever had a miscarriage(流产；失败；误送)?

No. I, um...I've been late before, but I don't...You know, I don't know. I don't know exactly.

Have you had any abortions(流产，堕胎；失败)?

Three.

That can make it more difficult.

I'm not trying to dissuade(劝阻，劝止) you, but please make sure you think long and hard before you decide.

But it's possible?

Assuming you and your husband fit all the criteria(（评判或做决定的）标准，准则，尺度 （criterion 的复数）)? Yes, it's possible.

Okay.

What? Well, that's hardly my problem. No, you get on it. It's... I have to call you back. What is it?

Sancorp's stock. It's up 35% in the last four hours. It's all over the financial news. Tusk is making a play.

Get Remy on the phone.

Congressman Underwood on line three.

I was just about to call you.

I need to meet with Tusk before he sees the President tonight.

He's already here. 

At the White House?

he decided to come in a few hours early.

His plane landed half an hour ago.

Do you know where he is? 

I don't know.

He had his own car pick him up. I just found out.

Remy's not in his office. I left word there and on his cell.

Look, you need to call me the moment you know where he is.

Okay.

It's just the lunch menu right now. I hope that's okay.

Yeah. That's fine.

Your server will be with you shortly.

Is Rachel working?

Uh, no. I don't think she's scheduled till Sunday. Stephanie will be with you this afternoon.

Thanks.

Should we come back Sunday?

I'll be right back.

Excuse me. Can I help you with something?

Yeah. I was just looking for the bathroom.

Unless you want to use the restroom in the office.

Who are you calling? 

Rachel.

Rachel Posner?

My name is Zoe Barnes. I'm a reporter at slugline.com. I know about Peter Russo. Rachel?

come on, Rachel.

You shouldn't have mentioned Russo.

She'll write back. 

I wouldn't if I was her.

How much do you know?

That you were with him when he was pulled over.(pull over 靠边停车开到路边拉过把车停在路边)

Who else knows? Just me.

I can keep it that way, but I need more.

There is no more. 

You're lying.

Yeah, I was with him when he got pulled over. They took him away and let me go. I don't know what happened to him.

He was never charged.

You know more than me, then.

No one ever came to talk to you?

About what? To keep you quiet.

You don't kiss and tell in that business.

Not even when it's a congressman?

Especially when it's a congressman.

Frank Underwood never approached(靠近，临近；接洽，交谈；对付) you?

Who's that?

You're too smart to play dumb(哑的，不能说话的；一时说不出话的), Rachel. You know who that is.

Name rings a bell. I try not to follow the news. Too many familiar faces.

How about Douglas stamper?

Never heard of him.

I've told you everything I know.

I know about what your father did.

If you don't help me, I'll write about Russo. I'll write that you were a prostitute(（尤指妇女）卖淫者，娼妓；出卖节操者), and I'll write about why you left home.

Go to town,(随便) bitch.

So?

She mentioned both you and your boss.

What exactly? She didn't say. All she seemed to know was that I was in the car with him when he got pulled over.

And you didn't admit to more than that?

No. I said everything exactly like you told me to.

You really think I'd spill(洒出，泼出，溢出；（东西）倒出) my guts(肠，肠道；内脏)? 

Calm(镇静的，沉着的；平静的，稳定的；风平浪静的) down.

Why didn't you tell me he was gonna hurt himself? I never would've done it.

How could I have known?

I just want all this to go away. 

It will. All of it. I promise.

Do you want me to order you dinner?

Where's Doug at? 

I don't know. He left early.

Call him for me, will you? 

Yes, sir.

Thirteen minutes from now, Tusk will meet with the President, if he isn't there already. You've never been an ally, have you? Pressing on with your slow, incessant(（令人不快的事物）不停的，连续的) march.

Time would've killed Russo if I hadn't, just as it will kill me someday. Kill us all.

Sir, I just got Doug's voicemail.

I wonder where he's at. Well, maybe this is him.

Freddy?

Frank. I had to trade up.(trade up 买更贵的东西韐豢将手中的东西折价换取更重要的同类东西) Sancorp's a big fish, but Raymond Tusk is a whale.

Can I get you something, Frank?

Nothing right now. Thank you, Freddy.

I'll leave y'all to it.

I hope you don't mind that Remy told me about this little secret of yours. I wanted a place where you'd feel comfortable.

Shouldn't you be at the White House?

How could I pass up the chance to eat the best ribs in Washington?

Remy told you about Sancorp.

As of closing bell today, I own 3%. By the end of next week, I'll own over ten. Enough to make sure they can't cause me any trouble.

A valiant(英勇的，勇敢的) effort, though. I respect that.

So why are we here?

I told you I'd give you until today to think things over. I'm a man who keeps my word. 
 
And I'm still not interested.

You wanted me to be more specific back in St. Louis.

That would be a good start.

Why did Britain go to war with China 150 years ago?

I'm in no mood(心境，情绪；气氛，情感基调) for riddles(谜语).

Humor(迎合，迁就；顺应) me a moment.

Opium.(鸦片；起麻木作用的事物，精神鸦片；麻醉剂)
 
It was bigger than opium, Frank. That was simply the excuse.

Peking wanted to call the shots instead of the west. It's the same problem we're facing now. But nobody wants a trade war, much less a military one.

And what's your opium?

Samarium([化学] 钐（一种稀有金属元素）)-149. I need it for my reactors. China controls 95% of the world's supply.

And you're worried about the imbalance in our currency(通货，货币；通用，流行；现时性), our foreign debt...

All of it. 

You already have the President's ear.

Trade tariffs(（政府对进出口货物征收的）关税，关税表) are controlled by congress. You have a lot more influence there than Garrett does. It's the reason I wanted you to stay there in the first place.

And what exactly would you want me to do?

Well, that part I don't know yet.

We'll have to wait and see how things play out with the Chinese.

I've already told you I will not do a blank check.

I must say I'm surprised, Frank. You have a reputation(名誉，名声) for pragmatism(实用主义；独断).

And I also have avoided a reputation for indentured(受契约束缚的) servitude(劳役，奴役；地役权；奴隶状态).

I never make an offer more than twice, Frank. Tell me now if I can count on your cooperation.

You're not offering cooperation, you're demanding(强烈要求；需要，需求) tutelage(监护；指导). So let me make you a proposal(提议，建议；（计划、建议等的）提出；求婚). I am absolutely willing to work together as equals. I will take your opinions seriously, just as the President does. But I will not bind myself to them in advance.(in advance 预先,提前,事先) If that doesn't interest you, fair(公平的；合理的) enough.

Good luck finding a vice President in the next four days who will prove as pragmatic(讲求实际的，务实的；实用主义的；（语言学）语用的) as I.You can't purchase(<正式>购买，采购) loyalty, Raymond. Not the sort I have in mind. If you want to earn my loyalty, then you have to offer yours in return. And if we can agree to that...Well, you're a man with imagination.

Wait.

If stamper was there himself, this goes much deeper than a lost arrest file.

Well, let's think about this. What did Russo gain(获得，赢得；受益；增加，增长) him?

A mansion(大厦，宅邸；<英>公寓楼) in Harrisburg.

Underwood thinks bigger than that.

Then what? 

I don't know.

He controls Pennsylvania. He has influence in the White House.

Walker needs the state for reelection...

No. No, it can't just be Walker. The President backstabbed(以卑鄙的手段陷害他人) him for the secretary of state nomination. It has to be something else.

The President would owe him.

But what?

They already meet once a week.

The education bill? 

I mean, what? What specifically?

He could be after the V.P. nomination.

That doesn't make sense,(有意义) though. The V.P. slot(（组织、团体等中的）位置，职位) is on the table because Russo tanked(彻底失败，破产；故意输掉比赛；). Underwood wanted him to win.

Unless he didn't. Maybe he wanted Russo to self-destruct(（审慎地）毁坏（某物，尤指火箭或导弹）；（故意的）毁坏).

To force Matthews to run.

Exactly. And then next week, when Matthews wins...

The President taps Underwood.

Mr. President.

Mr. Tusk.

Thanks for coming on such short notice. Have a seat, Frank. I have a confession(供认，供状；承认，坦白；忏悔，告解；声明，告白) to make.Raymond and I have known each other for years. We don't publicize(宣传，公布) it, but he's been a trusted advisor to me. And I sent you to St. Louis so he could spend time with you, give me his two cents.

On what, sir, if I may ask?

Offering you the vice presidency.

I told the President that, uh, in my humble(使谦卑，使感到自惭；（轻易）击败（强敌）) opinion, both he and the country would be well served by a man as experienced, intelligent, and loyal as you.

So I'm officially asking, Frank.

Sir, I... I don't know what to say.

Say yes.

Yes. It would be a great honor, Mr. President.

Meechum. I take care of my own, and you've proved yourself to be very valuable. I would like you to be part of my security detail once I get confirmed.

That's the Secret Service, sir. I'm capitol police.

Then I'll put you on the Secret Service. If you're interested.

I'd be more than interested, sir.

Good.

And I'm extremely grateful.

Keep being valuable. That's the best way to show your gratitude.

I will, Mr. Vice President.

Did the plumber finally come?

No. I fixed it.

Francis. So proud of you, Francis. I didn't do it alone.

I got here as quickly as I could.

Is something wrong?

I need you to be completely honest with me, Christina.

About what?

The other day, when I said that you should tell me if anyone from the press started harassing(骚扰；不断攻击（敌人）) you...

Zoe Barnes?

You said you wanted to talk about something on the phone.

Oh, no. That can wait.

No. Come on. Tell me.

I, um... earlier today...

The rowing machine, I saw, is broken.

oh, it's my fault, the cable(电缆；钢缆，缆绳；电报；有线电视) broke. I haven't been able to replace it yet.

what about going fot a run with me?

she's trying to smear(涂抹，涂上；诽谤，诋毁) congressman Underwood. it's a coordinated(地位相当的，同等重要的；（语法）并列的) campaign by everyone at slugline.

but she knew things.

like what?

about Peter. something to do with Kern losing the nomination.

and?

want me to drive alongside you, sir?

no, you stay here.

yes, sir.

you ready?

yes.
