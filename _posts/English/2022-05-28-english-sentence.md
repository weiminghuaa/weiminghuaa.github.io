英语的句式有很多种，下文将详细说明。

除此之外，还有几个注意点：

1. 注意句式的人称代词、be动词。

2. 句子一定要有动词

3. 名词前一般都有冠词：a、an、the
    ```
    This is a book.
    ```
    或物主代词
    ```
    This is my book.
    ```

## 人称代称

主格 | 宾格
---- | ----
I | me
you | you
she | her
he | him
it | it
they | them

```
I love English. // I是主语，用主格
He loves me.    // me是宾语，用宾格
```

## be动词

原型 | be | 过去分词
---- | ---- | ----
be | is/am/are | been

## 主谓

双宾语动词非常有限：give\show\send\take

句子作宾语

主    谓     宾
